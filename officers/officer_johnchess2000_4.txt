they already left.
for the weekend, they will be back 
i talked my dad into letting me stay home from school so that i could say goodbye.
hah damn i'm good.
thanks. *takes a bow*
hmmmmmm let me think...
:D whatcha want to do? Play monopoly?
what kind of movies do you have? anything you would recommend?
something that would make staying inside on a nice day worthwhile. heh
...
ELF.
Of course I have.
Will Farrel is hilarious.
clothes?
I mean, if you really want to come in leather chaps and a bridle, ok. 
but I think people would look at you funny.
sorry, I'm in a goofy mood today.
shoes would probably be helpful.
but, you should probably take them off before you come in. my mom can be pretty anal about her floors.
what do you want me to wear?
fair is fair, right? although, I didnt' really tell you...
what to wear. I just sort of left it up to you.
but, you offered to let me tell you.
so you get to tell me what to wear.
yes to both.
anything else?
hahah no colon!
skirt, tank top..what about socks??
my feet might get cold.
color?
:P
now I'm giving you a hard time.
ugh hold on brb
ok back
why dont you come over tonight?
oh. Well, I dont want the neighbors to see you, that's why tonight would be a little safer.
hmmm, that might work!
you are genius!
what time do you need to be at work?
i've never met anyone from here before, I'm a little nervous.
dont be mad.
have you met people from chat rooms before?
Good point. 
ok..in theory you coming over sounds like a great idea but now I'm feeling all nervous. Lets chat a little more please?
Ugh, I feel kinda dumb
I know. What about tomorrow? 
you were going to meet someone before and they chickened out?
did you eventually meet her?
oh. 
well then. can I call you first? I want to hear what you sound like
ok. I have to get offline I'll call as soon as I find the phone. :D
no you have a fine voice
i just am not ready
sorry
it sounds cool and all but
oh well
well i dont know you first of all.
and you are older
older than me, I mean.
and if my parents find out I'l be dead.
yes but the neighbors might see you come in, or leave.
and I'm not all that good at lying either.
meh
hah you are too funny. and sweet.
but no.
awwww, thanks.
>:D<
I am going to go eat lunch. talk later maybe.
