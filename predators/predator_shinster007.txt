yay- now we're dancing to old-time music
lol
actually the music on my ipod probably wouldn't be old-timer music
althoug I got some old classic rock songs on there
I like a variety of music- but mostly rock- alternative rock, some hip hop, and classic rock
I like some mellow stuff too
cool
Chrisitna Aguillerra is a cutie and she can sing! I like SexyBack by Justin Timberlake, Nelly Furtado is cool, and so is everyone else you mentioned
oh yeah- I'd like to see you dance
cool- I only know a few dance moves, the rest of the time I'm either winging it or doing other people's dance moves, or just making stuff up!
lol- that's cool
awesome
that would be cool if we were at a concert and danced to the music together- live!
cool- me too!
I goto mostly rock concerts, but I've been to a few non rock concerts and I still had a good time. 
My friend had a free extra ticket to see MaDonna , so I went with to see Madonna with him and his sister
yeah- it was at Madison Square Garden in NYC
She came out of a huge crystal disco ball in the center of the audience
yeah- that part was weird
I ws at Live8 in 2005 in Philly and that was totally awesome. My favorites that I saw were Will Smith, The Black Eyed Peas, Bon Jovi, and... Linkin Park with Jay Z
Yeah- they had the crowd grooving
yeah- the're from Joizey!
I've also seen U2 at the Wachovia Center in Philly- they were awesoem and the stage show was incredible
they're older, but they rocked the house!
yeah...I guess so. I've also seen outdoor concerts in NYC in the summer like The Cure in 2004.
I'm funny- I like going out and have a good time where there's like thousands of people, then other times I just like spending time with one person or with family 
lol- that's funnr
funny
awww you are a lot of fun
true
How is it that someone so young is so cool and fun?
I give you a high five and a hug
and maybe a kiss

I'll make sure you don't bust your butt
The first time I learned, I was falling down every two seconds going down the bunny slope
Once I got the basics mastered, then I had a gameplan to go from the beginner level to the intermediate level, then to the Expert level.
awwww- if your butt is still sore, I can massage it for you
lol
awwwww
let me rub it and kiss it and make the boo boo go away
there have been days when the slopes are really icy and I'll fall on my butt and my butt hits it really hard because I'm going pretty fast
awwww- one of my co-workers told me to wear wrist-guards because his nephew brkoe his wrists snowboarding
well, if you ever want to go snowboarding again, I'll personally work with you to make sure your butt doesn't get sore
I can lend you my sofa cushions- you can put the cushion in the butt part of your pants- then the cushion will protect your butt
awww- OK, then I won't do that
thanks- you're pretty funny too

if we ever do get together, then we can get some good Chinese food, then walk along the beach, hop into the waves, and have fun
yeah.....probably wouldn't get warm until June
oh yeah
hmmm, we could play on the beach, and walk along the coast of the beach with our feet getting wet holding hands then
you can bring your little doggies onto the beach

I could show you the cool gnarly scar on my left knee
I was rollerblading in NYC with my friend Dan. We went down this steep hill- I wasn't wearing any knee pads or even a helmet! I went way too fast and was about to crash into a bunch of people. I didn't want to hurt anyone, so I made my self fall onto the hard asphalt.
I had to get like 6-8 stitches on my left knee, but it was fine a few weeks afterwards
I looked like a mummy after I left the hospital!
because I hurt my left hand too
ehhhh- probably, but I'm used to sports-related injury. I played soccer and used to get cuts and bruises from skteboarding when I was a kid

They'll have a woman pose as an underage girl and see if older men get sexually dirty with her online and then the men will insisit on meeting them. The men would go to the girl'd house, then the guy from Dateline meets the guys in the kitchen and tells the guys they're on tv and then when the guys leave, the police are waiting for them outside.
