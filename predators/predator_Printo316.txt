John, right?
Ok.  Guess not.
Ok.
Well I know you're in Ft. Myers, but that's about the extent of it.
I dunno.  You're under my \"Ft. Myers\" buddy list. 
How you got there is the mystery./
Hah.
You have myspace?

Yeah, I know.
Is that the only pic you have?
Hhahaa.  Thanks  Don't make me blush.
And I think you're cute.
I would totally love ot cuddle with you!!
Well, send that one.
Is your hair the same length as it is in the pic you sent me, or did you cut it?
Oh, ok.
You like to make out, too?  ehehe.
Cool.  What else do you like to do?  :)
By the way.  I think you are sooooo cute.  But...  I think you should cut your hair shorter. I loooooooove short hair for some reason.  Haha.
Hhaha.  Are you really gonna cut your hair?
Yeah...
Is that too old?? 
What is the youngest and oldest you'd go for?
Well, what about your mom??  Wouldn't she be mad if she found out you were making out with someone my age?  Heheh.
Lol. Why is he creapy?
Where are your parents at, if I may ask??
Oh.  Ok.  I don't wanna get too personal and screw things up.  Just kind of curious why you live with your uncle, and not your parents, is all.
Oooooh.
Gotchya.
So, how could we ever hang out if you live with your uncle and you don't get much freedome?
For how long?
Oh, that's cool
.
Does he know about you?
Yes.
I'll call you Alvin...  So you can be my little Chipmunk.  :)
Hahaha.
I figured.  :)
So, can I get personal??
Well if I get too personal, you can tell me to shot up.
Have you ever been with a guy before?
What have you done before?
Damn, I'm jealous.
Cuase I'd love to do that with you.
How big are you??
I'm 6.5\"  Cut.
Cool.  :)
You like to j/o on the phone at all?  haha.
DUde, I'm so sorry for being blunt.. I havne't j/o in a while, so I'm in a reeeeeealy horny mood.  :(
Damn.
Was hoping since we cant be together, we could j/o together.
Yeah, but I live in Tampa.
I was in Ft. Myers Tuesday, Wednesday, and 
And I'm planning on moving there in about 2 months...  Hopefully. 
Well I hope to be down there again soon.  Before I move.
But I would like to keep in touch and get to know you even before I go down there.
Like we can talk on the phone sometime if you want.  We don't have to j/o... We can just talk.
And you need to get some more pics.  Heheh.
Are you really gonna cut your hair short??
Cause if you do, you MUST send me a pic!  :)
Really?  That's awesome.
Hahah.
You should take a bus up here and stay with me the whole week.  OMG..  We can like cuddle EVERY night!
You mean tonight?
Well it depends.
Cause from about 8:30 - 11:30 I won't be home.
I always go over my friend Anthony's house to watch the Sopranos.  It's a weekly thing.
Haha.  Ok.
(401) 316-3719
:)
You have a cell phoen?
He won't wonder anything when he gets the phone bill?
Well if you call me, you can give me your number, and then I can call you back so you don't have to use the minutes up on your card.
And if he's rich, ask him if he can buy you a bus ticket to Tampa!!
Then you can stay with me for the week.  :)
Hahaha.  Why?
Yeah.
I have a car, but it's not cool.  Piece of shit.  Hehe.
Hey, I gotta run now...  I need to get ready to go over my friends house.
And will be awesome when you do get a car.  Then you can drive up here to visit sometiem.  :)
Me too.  You seem totally awesome.l
Like, I think me and you will get along and have a kick ass friendship after we meet.  Like we can play video games and shit together.
You too, Chip.  Keep in touch!!!  Please.
Awesome.  :)
Cool.  Looking forward to it.  :)
*Hugs*  :)
You didn't call.  :(

Hah.  So sneak in his room and grab his phone.
Ok.
Damn.  :(
Not sure.  But I'll have my phone on me all day. Call anytime.  Though if I'm at work, I won't have much time to talk.

But I guess I'm gonna go to bed now...
Ok cool.  Talk to you then cutie.

Sounds good, cutie...  I'm home now, so whenever you want to call is good for me.  J
Dan...
Man, I hope you can call me tonight!
He always leaves his cell phone behind when he goes?
Well, you should ask him if he can leave it behind tonight, then.
Haha.  Go do it now!!
Haha.  No, I'm here.
I was looking for my cat.
Come to find out, the poor bastard was locked out on the patio all day.  Heh.
Yeah, he's fine though.
Yeah.  :)
PS:  I wanna cuddle with you.
:)
Well...
I'm actually gonna go in the other room and watch some TV, so I won't be by the computer for a while.
But I'll have my cell phone, so call me!!  :)
Can't wait to hear your voice, cutie.
You still have my number, right?
Still have my number?
Ok.
Talk to you soon cutie.
I like you, don't worry man...  Just watching tv.  I'm watching wrestling now.  It'll be over around 11:15, so I should be online soon after that.  J

No cute gay boys in your school?
Oh.
That's cool.
Haha.  Thanks.  :)
Did your uncle pass out yet?  Maybe you can call me again tonight.
Oh.  :(
Well hopefully you can call me tomorrow.
:)
Haha.
hahaa.
I hope he doesn't abuse you when he's drunk.
Like either mentally, or physically.
Urrrhg.
Why?
He doesn't hurt you, I hope.
Hah.
Well, I just want you to be safe wherever you live.
That's good.
Why?
Awesome.  :)
Wish I was in Ft. Myers so we coulda hung out.
Hah.  I'm not gonna take your money.
It's just that it's a long drive to go down there just for a few hours.
Where would I sleep!?
Hhaa.  WHere does the dog sleep?  On the floor.  Ouchy back!
Well, it would be crowded with me, your dog, and you all in one bed!
Hah.  No.
It's your bed!
Oh, cool.  :)
Can we cuddle and make out?  :)
But seriously...  I don't know about this weekend.  I really should go to see my friend.  I haven't seen him in about 3 weeks now.  And we're like best friends.
Hah.  I don't know man.  I have to think about it.
And how do you know for sure that your uncle is going away?  And how do you know exactly when he'll be back?  I t would totally suck if your uncle came back and he saw us cuddling in the same bed!
Cool.
He goes away a lot, huh?
Cool.
So, when are you gonna get that haircut? hahaha.
By the way...  Where in Ft. Myers do you live?
I don't know the area that well at all.  All I know is like 
Cuase that's where I stay when I'm down there.
No idea where that is.
Yeah, I could do that I suppose.  Heh.
No idea.  I'm not from Ft. Myers, so I don't know the area well.  I know where the Edison mall is, though!@
Ok.
That address to the school is literally THREE mintues from where I usually stay.
That is so close!
Yeah.
I stay right off of which is right off of.
It's not even 2 miles away!@
ok.
Haha.
Hurry, cause I need to go in a minute.
I need to j/o sooooo badly, then need to get a drink of water, then relax on the couch to wach a show, and then get to bed.
Dind't pull up.
Just give me your address and I'll put it in myself.
Han gon a sec. 
What's the zip code there?
Wow.  Dude. That is soooooo close.
I wish I knew you when I was down there last week!!
Not even 4 miles away!
Are you gonna j/o tonight too?
What time?
Cause I wanna do it the same time as you cause that would be hot.
And when you j/o, I hope you will think of me!!
I'll only j/o thinking of you only if you want me to.
Hah.
Well.  It's 12:15 now...  Can you j/o at 12:17?
Cool.
Ok.  I'll let you go now so we can j/o together.  Hah.
Umm.  Try to call me tomorrow.
Nite nite man.  Sleep well!
*Hugz*
15 PM 
Sweet.  :)
Yes.  :)
Hmmm.
Can you call later?
So.  When are you getting a haircut?  :)
Just wondering
Cause I've been giving it some serious thought about your proposal to me coming down there this weekend.
As of now, there's an 85% chance I'll come down Saturday.
But I'll have to come back Sunday.
And I can't be with you the entire time, but we can hang out for a little bit at least.
Like MAYBE sleep over Saturday night...  But I probably wouldnt' come over til late Saturday night.  And then leave around noon on Sunday
If I sleep over, can we cuddle, and maybe kiss?
Cool.  :)
I'm gonna try.  I think I should be able to do it.
BUT... You're gonna have to call and keep in touch with me and stuff.
Are you gonna have your uncs cell phone while he's away?
Ok, cool.  That way you can call and we can make plans for me to stop by and hang out.
What else you wanna do when we hang out?
No.  It's up to you.
What do you wanna do?
Haha.  Yeah.  And it would be pointless for me to drive down there just to drive back that same day.
Haha.
Yeah.
So...  What else do you wanna do then?
Indoor our outdoor?
No...
I mean is the jacuz inside or out?
Maybe we can go in there naked?  :)
Maybe we shouldn't though...  Cause I'd probably wanna do stuff with you.  Like fool around and stuff.  Heh.
Hah.  Well I don't wanna fool around with you if you don't wanna.
I'll like wanna give you head and stuff.
Hah.
What have you done with guys before??
Well I don't think it would hurt you if we did that, cause I'm a bottom. 
You ever wanna try topping someone?
Haha.  But I really don't want to do anything that you don't wanna do!
Like what?
I don't have any lube or anything.  :(    Do you?
How?
Hmmm.
I don't have any condoms, though.  :(
Can't afford any, really.  :
What do you mean?
Oh, like sexual sickness stuff?  No man.
Cool.
Maybe we can do it without a condom...  But you have to PROMISE me you are clean. 
You sure?
Ok.  We don't have to get condoms then
It'll be so hot to feel you cum inside me.
Omg... YOu hav enoooooo idea how hard I am right now. Heh.
Seriously.
I think I'm gonna go in a minute so I can j/o actually lol.
Did you j/o thinking o me yesterday?
Just sorta?  :(
How come?
Hmm.
Well...  Can you go j/o in a few minutes?
So we can try the same thing as last night.  J/o at the same time. 
Cool.
Ok.  So when do you wanna do it then
?
Well, are you hard?
Do you wanna walk doggy first?
Ok hurry..  Cause I can't wait much longer!  Lol.
Won't be weird.
Be hot.   Knowing that we're j/o at the same time thinking of
Why?
When are you gonna do that?
Noooo.
I need to j/o soooo bad.  Heh.
Hah.  No it isn't.
It's not like we're talking, or you can hear me or even see me.
Well.
Did you get the Email I just sent you?
I hope you can call!  I wanna hear your voice again!
You really think so?  I hate those pics.
And the one with me laying down makes me look fat, and I'm not!  :(
I was worried you weren't gonna like the pics..  I was so nervous to send them.
You too.  :)
Ok.  I'm gonna be in the other movie watching some tv I guess.
Hope you can call.  If not, I should be on here a little before bed.
Bye cutie.  :)

He's driving?  I thought you said he was flying or something cause you saw his tickets??
And if I come, it won't be tomorrow, it will be Saturday afternoon.
I should be in town around 4 or 5 Saturday afternoon.  Then I'll be doing dinner with some friends.  I can probably hang out after that.  Maybe around 8 or 9.
And don't worry about  money.  I'm not taking any money from you.
And hopefully if we like each other, I can sleep over Saturday night, and then leave there about 1 in the afternoon.
SWEAT!!!
Maybe we can still do pizza.  I won't eat too much though, but pizza would be cool for us, cause it goes great with watching a movie.
Hahaa.  I didn't mean to say sweat.  I meant to say sweet.  
I got a haircut yesterday!  :)
You're sweet too.
Really?  Awesome! 
You should take pics!!!

If you want/can, you can call me to tell me to go on the computer if you want, or you can call just to talk, or...  I will be back on the computer later on.  J Hope to talk to you soon.

Hah.  He can't be that bad of a person!!
Yeah.
Did you watch tv or anything tonight?
You were in the jacuz all night?
Your skin must be all wrinkly.  Haha.
Oh..
He's still packing?  Shouldn't take him this long!  Gees!
Wish he wasn't on the phone so you could call me!  :(
Oh.
Wish you were here tonight.  I wanna cuddle!
And hug and kiss you.
Ok.  :)
:)
Of course.
And you're going to call me tomorrow too, right?
We can still get a pizza.  I'll probably just have like only once slice, though.
Not sure what time we're doing dinner.  I think we're eating around 5 maybe?
Pepperoni and cheese.  It doesn't matter.  What do you like?
Ewww.  No.  I wouldn't want that on pizza, either.
Well I guess I'm gonna go lay down now.
Yeah.
Just gonna lay down in bed.  
Pretty tired.
But if your unc gets off the phone you can call me at anytime.  Even 3 in the morning if you want!!
Ok.  If not, just call me tomorrow.  :)
Thanks you too!
Ok. Well night cutie.
I'll miss you til we talk tomorrow.
Me too.  I'd love to be holding you close right now. 
Hey.  Quick question.  Do you wear boxers or briefs?
Ok. Just curious.
I wear boxers.
I like them better too.  More comfortable.
Feel free to send me an Email tonight if you want.  Would love to wake up to an Email from u!!@
Yeah?
No, what were you gonna say?
Hah.  Thanks cutie.
But I think we need to meet before you love someone!!  :)
Yeah, it's cool.  Don't worry about it.  I love talkign to you on here, and on email and on the phone too.  :)
What?
How?
Hha.
OK>  :)
Hah.
Ok.  Goodnight cutie.
Send me an email if you can.  :)
*Hugz*
Ok. :)
*Bigger Hugz*  :)
Hah!  I sent you an Email before you could send me one this morning!  J Just wanted to say hi, and let you know that I miss talking to you! Won't be by the computer til late tonight, so give me a call later if you can.  Hope to talk to you soon.  *Hugz* Dan...
Hey.
What's up?
Why?
Well, that's not too bad.  At least we can still hang out tomorrow.
:)
What time is he leaving tomorrwo?
I'll be headed down there around 2:15, so I should be in town around 3:30 - 4:00.
What time do you usually wake up in the am?
Yeah, my friend is cooking dinner for when I get down there. Then we're going to play mini golf after dinner, and then we can hang out when I'm done with that.  :)
And was wondering what time you wake up cause I was gonna see if you wanted to call me in the morning after you wake up.
I hope so!
What time are you going to the movies?
Ok.
Ok, cool.
9 is a good time.
That'll work.
Sure.
What time is your unc coming back?
Yeah.  Pizza and movies go excellent together.  :)
What time monday morning?
Ok...
I'm not sure what time I'm coming back.
If I leave Sunday, it'll be Sunday night.  The only other option is if I leave Monday morning, but I would have to leave early Monday morning, like around 7:00am, which means I would have to wake up around 6:00am to shower and stuff.
Haha.  Ok cool.  :)
You know what my fantasy is?
Well, a couple of them actually.
Sex at night time.  And first thing in the morning when we wake up would be hot.
But...
I've always wanted to fall asleep at night, and wake up in the middle of the night, like really late to someone jacking me off, or just playing with me.
You ever done that?
Yeah.  But I bet once you fall asleep at night, you wouldn't wake up til morning.
No.  But usually people don't wake up in the middle of the night.
And you can't set an alarm, cause that would wake me up too.  :)
I doubt it.
Cause you will be so comfortable by cuddling!
Ok.
Ok. 
Hah.
I wish you could call tonight!  :(
Oh.
Maybe you can steal it from him after he's off and call quick.  :)
COol.  :)
Me too.  I hope we like each other in person as much as we do on here!
Well, I think I'm gonna go in the other room and see if there's anything good on tv.
Then I need to get to bed soon cause I have work in the morning.
But...
If you can get the phone, call me!!  Even if it's at 3:00am, it's ok if you wake me up.  :)
Sweet.  :)
Can't wait to cuddle with you!!
Ok.  I'm gonna go see what's on tv now anyway.  
Or send me an Email, and I'll read it in the morning when I wake up.  :)
Hugz!!@
Hey there.  I'm going to work shortly so I won't have access to a computer, so just wanted to remind you to call me, because if not, then I will have no idea that we're still on for hanging out tonight, or know when to come over and stuff! I'll also need you to give me your address so I can pull it up in Mapquest so I don't get lost!  Haha. Ok, hope to talk to you soon!  Don't forget to call me!  J Dan...
a  
Hah.  Well I'm not sure if we're going mini golfing anymore, but if we do, I'll be sure to grab you a pink ball! I hope you're good at directions because I won't have access to a computer when you call tonight, so sadly I won't be able to mapquest anything. ;( Anyway, I'll talk to you a little later on.  :) Dan...
