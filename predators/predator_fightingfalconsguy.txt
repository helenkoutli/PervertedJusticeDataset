But I did ask when I should call you for a date, if not five years from now, then when? :p
It's great :p
Trust me
No, it' sup to you, you see it's true, the decision is not mine, but yours to make in time. :p
What is that?
You're the girl, give it a whirl!
Ok, so should I call you for a date in 4 years?
Awwwww
:(
Ok, what can I say or do to make you un-bored?
I did that about an hour ago, when I was cleaning my monkey's cage
It's all I could do to get him back in his room! :p
I had a ferret. :p
Ok, should I call you for a date in 3 years??
I sure did
Named stinky

So, call in 3 years?

Really??
What do you want me to give you for your b-day? :p
Hahaha, kinda.  
But what else would you like?
Ask, and I'll let you know. :p
Use your imagination silly goose
Ok, no goose
:p
Gotta let me know.  Your opportunity is going....going.... :p
Ok, in order to give you four options, give me an idea of what things you'd want.  And I'll give you the options. :p
Not really.  Just let me know what would put a smile on your face, and I'll come up with ideas off of that. :)
Awwwwwwww, you like cuddling? :p
Well, I can get you CD's, or DVD's for entertainment.  Food is wide open to anything y ou want.  Monkey's may be hard to get, so probably not.  Cuddling, well, you're sweet!  I'd cuddle with you in a heartbeat, just gotta keep me from kissing ya. :p
:">
Yes.  Ugly me
How tall are you?
;)
Well, you have your options, which would you like, and when would you like it? :)

Hahaha, that sounded so bad. 8-|
You wouldn't be ignored
