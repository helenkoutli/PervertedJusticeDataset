lol
i just like to have my arms around a lady
i like to cuddle
yes, when i have a g/f they do

i am too shy
that would be nice if she would
i would even travel some to meet her
but it hasnt happened yet
it is ok

sometimes it takes forever to get into a room
way too many bots
yep
no comment ;)
jk
:\">
like i said, i am goofy
most of the time
i wish i could find someone as nice as you 
:\">
i am a dirty old man
=))
yes i have been in love
it is wonderful when it happens
didnt work out
my dad was still alive and i was helping take care of him
and she wanted more than i could give
my dad was more important at the time
you will be in love one day
maybe you will fall in love with me ;) 
but i am too old for you for that 
:(
yes they do
it doesnt matter to me but to most it does 
i agree
i work for winco foods in their general office
i do payroll for them
i have been there over 8 years
yes, i like it
i did
i have a degree in business admin and accounting
why do you think ages are dumb? 
i dont think it should be
i am not freaked out about it
i would take you to dinner and a movie
yep
and whatever else you wanted to do 
go for a drive, look at the stars
:\">
we would make it your day
anything you wanted to do
i am serious
i am glad it makes you feel good
:)
if you could do anything you wanted, what would it be
yes
ok
it can be
i would like to spend the day with my special lady
picnic
maybe swim
cuddle
nice dinner and a movie
and then make love all night long
yes it does
that is what i thought it would be
:-*
thank you
we could do that 
except for the last part 
i would come and spend the day
i dont think we should do the last part though
you are 14
you sound disappointed that i said we shouldnt do thelast part
you want to do it with me? 
then you should wait until you find someone you love 
it is a very special time
but i would behonored if i were the first 
yes i would
what have you done with a boy?
i am sure you liked it
it is enjoyable
i would let you do whatever you wanted 
yes
:)
me to
yes we do
at first maybe
not after talking and cuddling
what about your dad?
he leaves you alone?
wow
i know
you dont need one
and filer isnt a big town to get into trouble in
what?
neither am i
i am i a small home
thank you
>:D<
i have met a few people
yes, it was
kool people
had coffee or a coke
girls 
we decided there was no connection
oh well
then we will be friends
and enjoy each others company while we talk
i hope that doesnt happen
you could come here for a weekend sometime to
i could take you to the mountains
or around boise
you are welcome anytime
but i dont think you would get your dads permission
cool
i can understand that
yes it is
pretty much
cool
ok
sweet dreams
same here
nite
hello
how are you tonight
bored
other than that ok
i am not one for the bars
i am more of a home person
doesnt help though when one wants to cuddle
oh well
thank you
>:D<
thank you again
wish i could get it in person...oh well 
you arent here
and i am not there
wish i were though
yes it would
:-*
yes, i accomplished a lot around the house
i wish
i still have a lot more cleaning to do
yea and tossing of stuff
yea, i have way too much stuff
and i only made a small dent
i am finally going through my parents stuff
and stuff i have acquired
my mom 12 years and my dad a little over 5
i went through some stuff 3 years ago but i still have way too much
last one i had i made very little and they are a lot of work
i would rather donate
thanks
yes it does
that is what weekends are for
yes, i did manage a nap this afternoon
yep
especially if you have someone to cuddle with 
i cuddled with my cat
she adopted me several years ago
Ponch
the neighbers named her
it is probably a good thing we arent close tonight
maybe i will go take a cold showre
shower
help cool the hormones
yes, very
just do
yea, want to help me out
jk  
never mind
it is how women have helped men forever
ok
about what?
not your fault
you are only 2 hours give or take away
not too bad
but you need to find someone you are in love with for your first time
i know
yes
or you can always ask someone
i can understand that
if you asked me, i would say yes 
but you would  have to ask 
really 
ok
true, but i since i am who i am where i am, you would have to ask
ok
i like you to
i understand
if we were together, i you wouldnt have to ask
you would only have to say no if you didnt want to
no
you are my friend
:)
i am just saying that if you ever wanted to, i would be with you
>:D<
maybe one day we will give each other a hug in person
i go through filer once in a while on my way to jackpot
it has been a while and i might be going again in a month
k
front
top
side
middle
bottom.
=))
yep, that is me
just goofy
do you ever come to boise?
i know that
have you ever been there
there is lots to see and do
one day you will
you can tour the capital, old prison, some museums, the big mall
i think you would like it
i havent been in the capital for a long time or toured the old prson for a while
it is difficult to imagine being stuck there
no tv, no indoor plumbing
glad it wasnt me
me to
so would i
so am i and my diet wont let me eat now
i have now lost 23 pounds in 4 weeks and one day
i want to lose another 20
yes it is
thank you
i think i am going to call it a nite and relax a little before bed
maybe next time i go to jackpot, we can meet for a coke for a little while
ttfn
bye
good evening, how was your day?
i had a very busy day at work
i am glad it is over
thanks, it was a typical monday
phillip
what is your first name
hi kaycee
yes except i did not bowl very good last nite
i am not sure
i have lost a lot of weight lately from a diet and that could be it
yes, in a mixed doubles league
it is a fun league
i enjoy it
but i am ready for the season to be over
33 weeks
yes it does get to be long by the end of the year
next week is the end and it is a fun nite
kind of.
lots of food and the top 4 teams bowl to see who wins the league title
but i wont be eating anything
not this year, last year we were
i am on a high protein diet that limits what i can eat 
it is ok, i chose to be on it
i have lost 23 pounds in 4 weeks
i have another 4 that i am going to be on
yes it is
not really
just an average guy
i got tired of being overweight
and it isnt too bad
protein shakes, oatmeal, protein bars, soup
and one small meal a day
i have something every 2-3 hours
lol
it is about 1000 calories a day
not a lot to it
what did you do today
that sounds like fun being with friends
k
it is ok
do you need to go?
ok
what did you get? water?
cool
i like cold water best
i used to but cant stand it anymore
yes, i have had one since i started this diet and it tasted awful
it amazed me
i think it is
i used to have 2-3 a day
:)
i have never tried it
i liked diet pepsi
they arent that good for you
me to .... now
>:D<
thank you
i am glad you are my friend
you are a nice young lady
i can understand your lonlieness in a small town
i lived in john day oregon a couple of years.....very small...2000 people and about 8000 in hte whole county
that was boring
it was where my first job out of college was
very isolated and boring
>:D<
and your dad not being around a lot doesnt help either
that will help
true
and you can do whatever you want
well...for the most part anyway
you dont have too much longer before you can drive
then you will be able to go anywhere
:)
i remember waiting to drive
yes it is
but it will pass quickly
when is your b-day
1 year 10 months
then you can go to twin, it isnt far
that isnt far
yes, the mall is there and movie theaters
and more boys.
lol
plus the mall for shopping ;)
why am i not surprised
some guys do to
:)
sometimes
not yet, but soon
i never tossed my old pants away.  I do like second hand stores
never know what you will find there
usually books
i bought an almost new sofa and recliner used
very good deal
me to
i got a new breadmaker from someone who must have gotten it as a gift or more than one
me to
it is better made than the new stuff
back when people dressed up more
yep
i like to wear a suit but i dont often
slacks and a nice shirt but no tie
i had a job where i wore a suit all the time, but not anymore
it is called dress casual
no tie
yes and no
sometimes it was a pain to have the tie on 
if the collar was too small it feels that way
nope, i am an only child
and both my parents passed away
i have an aunt and uncle and cousins in the midwest
i have my cat :)
she loves me :)
cool
i like cats but i am not a big fan of dogs
unless they are trained
i like dogs if they dont try to lick your face
:)
lol
what ?
congrats
it should
i havent thought about it much
last year i went to russia to visit friends
very different
i do not speak very much russian
but many people there speak many languages
i ended up half way across russia
not this time
the first time i went 4 years ago i was kind of scared
yes
to a city called novokuznetsk and a city called kemerovo
they are in south central siberia
i also spent a day and a half in moscow touring
you will one day
you have the opportunity to travel 
all it takes is money......
it is nice to travel with someone though
cool
yes, i met friends there
the first time it was very scary
but i decided to go anyway
a little bit
we used a translation dictionary and a computer a lot
but we also spoke slowly
they thought the little russian i spoke sounded very good
it wasnt as difficult as it sounds
it was a lot of fun
but very different at the same time
i was 14 hours time difference from here
1 hour to salt lake
4.5 hours to jfk new york
10 hours to moscow
4 hours to kemerovo
yea, especially stuck on a plane
i didnt sleep much on the plane
if i go again, i will take tylenol pm
you will
=))
yup
i am goofy
:)
=))
me to
just like me
i know, 5:45 comes way too early for the alarm to go off
yea
soon it will be summer break for you and you get to sleep in
not fair :((
:P
you to
sweet dreams
>:D<

i cant decide between bbq burger or a chicken breast
that is what i am leaning towards
:)
how was school
yes, i am doing good
i can understand that
i have been thinking of taking a couple of days vacation
but not sure if i will go anywhere
yes it is
if i could think of  somewhere to go for a couple of days i would but right now i cant think of any place 
i have to be back sunday nite for my last nite of league
maybe golf but it is a little cold for that
yes it is
hot springs sounds good to
maybe i will go to 1000 springs, there is a pool there
have you ever been there
neither have i
i am sorry
i know what that is like
yep it is
yum, where is mine?
jk
yum
what are you up to tonight?
:(
me to
i should do some stuff around the house but not sure i will
yea, especially when it is cleaning or paying bills
i will let you pay mine then....lol
lol
any good movies on? 
yes
i dont know what is playing
what is it about?
oh yea, i think wil farrel is the star

:D
:\">

:)
yes, it was scary
lol
hmmmmmm
yes, i understand being out of school
especially when it is nice

it will be nice for you
like where?
not too far away
yea
boise isnt that far either
2 hours
nope
jackpot is only 3 from nampa
not too bad3

lol

me ;)
:\">
>:D<
i am glad you are my friend
thank you, you do to
perhaps one day we will give our hug in person
who knows
yes it would

on blue lakes blvd
i better go cook my burger
i will be back later
tttl
ta ta till later
ttfn
ta ta for now
bye
good evening3
how are you
i am good  but bored
as usual
oh well
big time
unless you are bowling it isnt a lot of fun
>:D<
thanks
wish i had someone here to hug
:(
yes it is
lol
why are you bad?
i dont think so
ok
missed you
:-*
what would you like to chat about tonight
where is your dad?
that doesnt give you much to do
:(
must be lonely then
>:D<
probably
i have a lot of stuff to go through and toss
yep, slowly but surely
i wish
i have to be somewhere at 10
but i will sleep until 7 or so
for me it is
true
i used to do that
i always did
part of the time
do you?
ok
>:D<
if we were close, i would take you to church if you wanted
or anywhere you wanted to go
:(
only 2 hours
yes that is true
]but i wouldnt mind the drive if you want me to come see you sometime
cool
what would you want to do
you tell me
it is your time to do whatever you want
true
there is a nice picnic area not too far from where you live towards balanced rock
or dinner in twin
sounds good
if it was earlier, and your dad at his g/f i would have come down tonight
:\">
i am just me
most would think i am a dirty old man for wanting to take you on a picnic or to dinner
i know you dont
no you wouldnt
nope
it isnt as though we are going to do anything we shouldnt
i am not looking for that
:)
i just had a little pudding
but i like steak
or on a picnic, sub sandwich, potato salad, chips
cool
i havent seen the others but i used to read the comic all the time
maybe i will rent the first two
i think spiderman will be better
ok
you will have to let me know
ok
i dont want you to get into trouble
ok, i dont want to get into trouble either for  taking you on a picnic or to dinner and a movie
i know
:)
yes we will
i will like you, you are my friend
i hope you will like me
yes, the true beauty of a person is what is inside them
it is true
that is true
:-*
i dont think you have to try to be nice, i think you are nice
you are very welcome
what do you want to know?
ask me something and i will tell
hmmm
i think it would be when an ex g/f and i had sex while her 3 roommates were asleep in other rooms
nope and she was noisy
she was a nymphomaniac
she wanted it all the time
almost every day
i thought so to
20 or 21
i was umpiring a softball game and went to make a call and the seat of my pants ripped out
what about you?
i laughed to
that would be embarassing
and it probably hurt
lol
i am sure it did>:D<
she and i decided we didnt have enough in common besides her wanting sex all the time
although i would like to find someone like her now
:\">
we werent right for each other
we did a lot of that anyway before we broke up
i wouldnt mind finding someone like her again
maybe
i would want her to be as nice as you are
:\">
it is possible
sex isnt the most important part of a relationship though
it is only one part
>:D<
yes it is very important
yes, that is very true
and when you care for someone it makes the sex better
how much do you have
never mind
i shouldnt have asked
it was a rude question
if you want to talk about it i dont mind listening
i will answer any question you may have to
if that is what you want to talk about, i will talk to you about it
same here
lol
i am sleepy and should go to bed
long day tomorrow
thanks you to
sleep well
>:D<
sweet dreams
of me
;)
:\">
how are you
bored but good
no, why?
i dont see you online
:-w
lol
yup3
it is ok>:D<
thank you
i have toooo much stuff to get done 
i got a little done
little at a time
did you get to sleep in
or stop because i am tired of it
not fair :(
i used to sleep like that
my cat wakes me up when i do get to sleep in
she think i am late getting up for work
or wants out
she can wake up up instead
lol
then i can sleep in
shopped some at jcpenny
took a nap
messed with some settings on the computer
i bought a new wallet to replace the one i have that is falling apart
couple of new smaller belts
and some briefs
lots of fun
yep
i have worn boxers but i prefer briefs
which one
yea, those were good
but i prefer looking at the ladies....;)
:\">
probably not
i am sure they wear something unless they are like brittney spears
i would have thought anyone would be
i cant imagine not wearing something
i doubt that
you would get a lot of unwanted attention
i have seen some women without bras but i dont think it is appropriate
lol
i was going to say unless she was that way around the house with me
not if she was my g/f or wife in the house with me
then it would be up to her
why is that
that is true
some women do that to
depends on where they are at
i have to admit, i would look if i saw someone not wearing a top
most guys would stare with their mouths open
most women would put a hand over their mouth in shock
yes it would
probably not the topless but i have seen braless here
no, but i look
kind of hard not to
i am sure they do
just as i am sure you girls check out the guys
lol
>:D<
what do you notice first about a guy
me to on a woman
i think you can tell a lot about a person by looking into their eyes
:-B
me to
it is the way they carry themselves
confidence
i have known some physically attractive people who were ugly inside
and visa versa
too many people only look at the outised
outside
big time
i am glad you are my friend
:x
:\">
i am joe average
you are you and that is what is important
just because you are young doesnt mean you are a kid
maturity does come with age but some mature faster than others
i am still a kid at heart
life is too short to be serious all the time
cool
i like my naps....lol
i just dont get to take enough of them....
working kind of makes them difficult to take during the week
what did you do all day
did you bowl?
cool
:)
could be
did you think of me today?
same here
yup, that is me:-B
i agree
i have bought stuff off ebay and amazon
sometimes i research stuff
chat
what about you?
what kind of stuff
like what?
cool
news, world events
mostly i check email
do you get wet?
=))
lol
goofy me strikes again
i wish we could be b/f - g/f ..... i like you
:\">
but i will settle for friends
your dad wouldnt like it
dads have a way of finding out things
neighbors and friends have ways of telling them
>:D<
thank you
i know
:x
:)
you are a nice young lady
:)
i wish i were younger
but i am one day older than i was yesterday
that is true
it doesnt to me
but it is how others view things that is a problem
and i want kids
even if they are step kids
but that will probalby not happen
sorry, i am just being \"old\" tonight
not for our friendship it doesnt
if it did, i would have never chatted with you in the first place
i think i better call it a nite before i say something stupid
>:D<
:)
:x
i want you to know i could very easily fall for you
you are special
:)
thank you
nite
>:D<:x:-*
you type like me :)
sweet dreams
thank you
nite
hi, how are you?
i am ok
need to go take a cold shower
then get on the heating pad
my back is bothering me
i was in a car accident about 2 months ato
yes, i did
thanks
i have been going to a chiropractor
not for the back but the heating pad does
sometimes i wake up in the middle of the nite and get up and turn on the heating pad for a while
:)
yes, it was very busy at work
made the day go by fast
what about you
not fair
:(
:(
:((
i do have 3 weeks coming
no plans on where i will go
not this year
at least that isnt in the plan for now
good memory
next  year my best friend and his parents want me to go to wales with them
yes, i am looking forward to it
maybe one day you will get to go
you will
i will fly with you when you do
i think it would be a lot of fun
cool
just worked and i have some paperwork that i should be doing tonight
instead of chatting
i can understand that
soon
then it is sleep in time
party time
boy time.....lol
you guess?
>:D<
i am sure they are interested in you
ah
what age do you like?
that is good
yes and i agree
you need a good guy period
you will find something interesting
>:D<
thanks, i needed that tonight
it is ok
a little bit
more of wanting to talk to someone in person nite
all my friends are busy
:(
:(
it can be boring or too quiet
i know the feeling....like a fifth wheel
:(
i dont want to have sex on the first date and that eliminates a lot of women
really
it is not what i am after
most women i have met, it is what they want 
so i have pretty much given up dating
yes, i do
but i want to know someone first
part of the reason i like you so much is that you dont say you want that
i want a really good friend
some day with the right guy it will be
but not to do it with everyone you can
same here
or anything else
i am glad you are my friend, we think the same about a lot of things
:)
you will know in time
you will
thanks
there is someone for each of us.  sometimes they are near and sometimes far away
kinda sorta
we were engaged for a year
but she has a little boy who is almost 5
and her ex wont let the boy leave Russia
yea
so we gave up but remain best friends
thanks
yes, i was with her and her family both times i was there
i think she is 26 now
she was 22 when we first met
she doesnt think i will be happy there
if she asked, i would move
but a year ago when i was there, almost exactly a year
she said i needed to find someone that I could bring to the usa
i hope so
yes, anything is possible
for now, i have found you, my friend :)
:\">
you are a special woman 
:\">
i am \"joe average\"
thank you
:\">
:\">
you are making me blush
you are the one who is sweet
i am the same in person as here....except i am shy in person
i should let you go do your hw and i need to get to what i need to
ok take care
bye
did you get your homework done?
cool
i am proud of you
most of what i needed to do
i didnt figure that i would get everything done that i needed to
me to
too much to do and not enough time
big pain
:\">
you make me blush
:)
thank you
yes i am back on the heating pad
i need to go to my chiropractor or have a massage
either one would help
:\">
i would like that
it is the middle to upper part of my back that hurts the most
yes
my chiropractor has a massage therapist that works on my back
they do feel good
yes
sometimes
they make you feel good and relaxed afterwards
one day he will
that or a day at a ladies spa
:)
you should be
everyone should be once in a while
of course
na
i know ;)
>:D<
so do you
two
you are very welcome kaycee

you are a typical teenager....want to be on your own
i was the same way
most teens are
what do you mean take your age?

yes, if i knew what i know now
i would be more adventureous
do more things
date more
at 14?
if it was with you
i would party more
really
some parties get real wild
maybe someday
some drink a lot
some turn into big sex parties
some just stay cool
that is what i heare
hear
nope
yes, but i was too chicken
and my parents were strict
we were close though
i did like that

nothing serious
just means i want to cuddle
when i was in college, it was just a saying 
the screaming purple hornies......
lol

must be because i have lost so much weight
only thing i can think of
big time
no one to help me  out

picnic does sound good

i will do anything you want
all you have to do is say what you want to do and we will do it
yes, they are nice when it is cold
i will have to try on my swim suit to see if it still fits
it might fall off if it is
ewwww
i will have to go buy a jock strap though
now why do you think
no i dont, only the suit
they do but not to keep things hidden
unless you dont want me to get one
no, it is up to you
without
yes but i dont want to be standing at attention either
keeps it constrained
that and i dont want to brush up against you that way
that wont be a problem now
lately, i am that way a lot
really
i dont mind your asking
you arent nosey
i think the lost weight
and thinking of you
:\">
yes 
i am glad
it is yours if you want it
really?
what do you want to do with it
anything you want
sure it is
true
but it is yours to do with what you want
i will
i am sure i would be to
i know
maybe but you arent asking
all you have to do is know what you want
no guy wouldnt want it

i know we will have lots of fun
what do you want to learn
i will show you anything you want
bowl, golf
movies
some tv
i have always wanted to try anal but never have
not sure i could
never
some friends say if you have good lubrication, it is the best for both partners
but i dont know
i have also wanted to be with two ladies sometime but not sure i could do that either
it would be different
no
not a lot
yes
mostly i want to be with you
:x
i know you are sweet
i need to go for a while
kaycee, you take care
love you
bye
hi kaycee
>:D<
tired but good, how are you?
just around the house some
not a lot....too hot
it is supposed to be 30 degrees cooler tuesday
yea :(
too much
i will freeze my self......
i dont either
yup
not so much dreading it but i am ready for some kind of vacation
but i dont know where to go so i guess iw ont go anywhere
and no one to go with
i am going to try
me to
what do you want to do?
picnic sounds good
me to
>:D<
:)
sounds good to me
ok
it will be nice to talk to you in person
me to
wait.....
lol
:D
i am just ne
me
you are the cute one...i am old
i feel it tonight
achy back
it hurts a lot lately
from standing and walking differently from my lost weight
it is ok
just a  back massage on the left side would be nice
dont know why it hurts so much
i guess my posture is different
plus too many car accidents in my past
and i will be 49 in august
i am probably older than your father
not for friends anyway
>:D<
it doesnt
>:D<
i agree
yes it is
i am sitting in front of my ac
it is nice and cool
me to
but since you are in your room, you can have just a little clothing on and be ok
i have a ceiling fan in my bedroom
yes it does
she doesnt seem to mind it
right now she is stretched out on the front room floor
as usual
i need to take my shoes off
life of a cat in phillips house hold...spoiled
ah
that is better
i dont mind them
when i am outside
othewise i am out of them
cool
what is your favorite summer clothes
that sounds like it will keep you cool
:)
no comment>:)
i am bad
thank you
i like you anytime
:X
>:D<
are your top and shorts purple?
lol
nice
i am sure it is very comfy
hmmmmm:-?
you are welcome
:D
just reading your mind
nope
i am lost all the time
na, you arent lost
you can find your way anywhere you want to go
there are a couple that come to mind
disneyland
russia
niagara falls
yellowstone park
i would like to go back sometime
it was
i rode everything
teacups twice
was real dizzy
20-21 in college
nope, good friend in college
then i took my parents later
we had a good time
yes, we did tons together
yes but they figured i would marry late in life
i want to marry and have kids
yes
i do
but if i had, i owouldnt have been able to help my parents like i did
takes a special woman to want to help in laws
most people dont look after their own parents let alone in-laws
no but it is true
i am sure you will
some in-laws can be a pain though but most are good
you can always marry someone whose parents are a long way away
or someone like me whose have passed away
the right guy will come along and you will fall in love with him and it wont matter
>:D<
you dont need to be
:)
you should date several guys
each one of us is different
i dont know
i used to think that you could only love one person at a time
but now i think you can love several
there are many types of love
really
yes, when i find the right woman to settle down with i will love her but that does not mean that I cannot love other people to
i loved my parents just as I love my friends
but i am not in love
there is a difference there
i could very easily fall in love with you
:X
same here
>:D<
i like your hugs kaycee
me to
a small one
radishes, tomatoes, peppers, beets, peas and red spuda
spuds
i had to replant my peas and beets....starlings ate them
:D
yea, i put chicken wire over them this time, hopefully that will keept them out
average city size yard
i cant wait for the tomatoes...yum
i picked the last of the radishes today
no, i have enough to last a week to a week and a half
yum....all mine
no, i havent been
i have been eating soup only at work
it is ok
has helped me lose 44 pounds in 3 months
yes it is
i get to eat one small meal a day
15
i want to get to 190
3 weeks i will be close
then i will start backing off the diet
walk
although if i am able to come for our picnic, i will go off the diet for that
i do to
i want to meet you and see your purple clothes...:)

and tore the rotator cuff
now i have half the range of motion an
just by the hard massage she gave me
i complained to the office and her husband, one of the chiropractors was supposed to call me at 6:30 but of course he didnt
i dont know
i canceled my appointment for monday
i have been using ice and heat on it tonight
but it hurts like it did when i messed it up last summer
monday nite
yea
no fun at all
i didnt sleep much last nite and i dont think i will again tonight
i go in next friday for my diabetes check up
cant get in any sooner
they are but she really worked me over
and the others i had did feel good and helped loosen things up
i think she just got overly agressive
:(
thanks, but there is nothing anyone can do
if she did damage, then i will have to go to physical therapy again
last time it was almost 6 months and i was lucky with no surgery
i told he she was pushing my limit
it didnt really hurt while she was doing it
but i cant reach very far with my right arm or above my head
yea :(
it doesnt feel good
tylenol and aleve
x ray or mri
:(
i dont know what they will do until i talk to them
i may have to go to a lawyer :(
i think they will eventually talk to me when they see the brusing on my arm
yea, not as bad as a year ago but there are a couple of small bruises
yea
yes, fortunately i sit at a desk
most of the day
so it isnt too bad, but i cant file stuff in the top drawer
i am getting old before my time....lol
needless to say i am not a happy camper
>:D<
thanks, i needed that
never 
:X
wish i could get a real hug from you tonight but i know i cant
me to
:)
it was his day off so he might have gone out of town
oh well
i am but i am trying to stay calm
it wont do me any good to get mad
i am not sure i am coming saturday....depends on how much sleep i get and how my shoulder feels
:(
i am disapointed to
:X
maybe still saturday if i can sleep and dont hurt as much
me to
i want to meet you and go on the picnic
i just want to talk to you in person
:)
me to
:-*
not too bad
but if i had to make a sharp turn i would
but i dont drive to where i would need to do that
i drive the speed limit and not over
you are not the only one that cant believe it
i think she just got overly agressive but i will never have another massage
i had 5 others at the office and they were fine
once and two others
never had a problem
very
i tried a very hot shower this morning to losten me up but it didnt work
:((
sniff....:(

hi Kaycee
how are you
still hurting but a little better since i went to the chiropractor tonight
i also talked to my physical therapist that i used when i broke my shoulder
they dont want me to go anywhere but keep ice on my shoulder most of the weekend
:((
i am disappointed
>:D<
thanks
i just got home
i felt that when i talked to him this morning, he was more protectful of his wife
i saw the partner that i like better tonight
and i told the partner that i didnt want to see the other doc anymore that i have lost my faith in him
he said it was not a problem
no
the physical therapist said it does happen sometimes
that is what i thought this morning when i talked to the husband
thanks, last nite i spent most of the nite in my recliner
not a lot
i slept a couple in my bed and then cat napped in the recliner
lol
she does that to
she likes to sleep with me
part of the time....lol
yea and she sometimes moans
she does
what did you do today besides sleep in

and going downstairs, my basket shifted and my shoulders hurt real bad and i lost my balance and down i went
fortunately, i didnt break anything
i am just a klutz
i just need some luvin....that will take care everything
i probably would have tripped and fallen int the creek
:X
i am doing ok
some ultra sound and ice on my shoulders helps some
i went today and back wednesday
and then to my regular doc friday afternoon for my diabetes checkup
i am slowly bette
i would be better if i had the picnic saturday

but i get off work at 11 friday

my cat has been outside the last couple of nites
>:D<
it is ok, she is part inside and part outside
i know :(
she did some yesterday
when i watched tv in the recliner and napped
she purred a lot
me to

i am sure Ponch would like you
and let you pet her
:)
since you like animals, that would be good
that would never be easy
>:D<
thank you
wish that was a real hug tonight
:)
i just need a hug
but that is ok
me to
i will
we have a picnic to go on
then you can rescue me when i fall in the creek.....lol

i am not sure if it is allowed or not
that is true
maybe i will fall in on purpose if you will jump in to save me
lol
yes it would 
i am just me

:)
yes, my best friend died last october
i was either at his house or he was here
thank you
he is in a better place
he was in vietnam and was exposed to agent orange
had a bad heart
it is a chemical used in vietnam to kill all vegetation
and also caused defects in the human body
big time
he was a sniper there
yes
i dont know how many
it was war
no, i was just a little younger
i was lucky
he was 3 years older than me
just barely
me to
they were older when they married and gave up when i came along
sometimes, but i did a lot with my parents 
i miss them
but wouldnt want them back in the health they had
i just wish they could see me with my weight loss
one day i will
maybe you can take it on our picnic
i could take some of you to
if you want
ok
yes
not with a cat
yes if they dont lick my face
you must like dogs

sweet dreams kaycee
nite
hi kaycee
:x
>:D<
hot, how are you?
it is a little better
not as bad
no
taking lots of ibuprophin
i dont think that is how youspell it
no, they say that she tore loose old scar tissue and it is just taking a while to settle down
i think they just dont want to take responsibility
i have been and told them monday that my insurance should not be paying for something that they did....no response to that
i dont blame them for not taking responsibility....if they did i could sue them even though i wouldnt
me to
oh well
what are you up to tonight?
same here
hopefully you are making lots of money
>:D<
ic
you can babysit me....lol
jk
i was going to say i will come and we can take off for the weekend but my neighbor just came over and asked me to look after his place this weekend
oops
i hit the wrong button
i dont have any new pics
i can but have to be back the same day
to pick up the mail and newspaper
>:D<
i was thinking about me getting some place to stay so we could be together more during the day
so i wouldnt have to travel far to see you
.i know
ok
:X
i have missed you to
i t hought maybe your dad was keeping you off the internet
i would
i care for and about you kaycee

i would do just about anything for you
it is true
me to
i wish you lived next door
then we could talk all the time
yes it would
you could mow my lawn....lol
=))
jk
i know you would
i would squirt you with the water hose to keep you cool.....lol
i havent had a water fight in years
:)
not near by
back in the midwest i do
really
no, i talk to my uncle about once a month or so
my uncle is in his late60's and my cousins near my age
they have had them but i have never been invited
i guess they think i am too far away or the black sheep
no it isnt
i would if i knew far enough in advance to go
i would take you with me and see their reaction.....lol
jk
they would have a cow
;).
your dad would probably object to your going across country
oh well
that would work......NOT
#-o
that would be the same as running away for the weekend
just longer
you are welcome here anytime
i am >:)
probably
maybe
i wouldnt make you call
really
i am sure i would get in trouble
:X
:((
sniff

depends on how i sleep tonight.  last night i didnt sleep much again
not if i feel good 
i want to go on our picnic
you should make plans :)
with the fun days there you need to make plans to go out and have fun
maybe i will see you at the fun days
sorry, i am tired
i thought  you should go to the fun days and if i can come there, i will wander around looking at stuff
and hopefully meet
if not
it is ok
.i am not playing a game
i want you to have fun this weekend
and if i cant make it because of no sleep, then i dont want you to sit at home doing nothing
is there a carnival ?
what is there to see and do?
k
it is ok :)
i dont want to leave you hanging
when is the dance?
evening?
you will have fun there
:)
i like to watch people dance
thanks, i am not hurting as much, just slept bad last nite
ttfn
hi, how was the dance?
did you have a good time
did you go to the carnival?
what are you up to today?
same here
you seem down today
ok
hi kaycee
i guess you dont want to chat.  have a good nite
hi kaycee
how are you today?
so so....just very tired.  i got to bed late
other than that i am good
i went to a meeting in ontario and didnt get home until close to midnight
yes it is
especially for getting up at 5:30
and i have stuff i have to do before friday afternoon.
i am having insulation blown into my walls
i found out my house has no insulation in the walls at all
it will help keep it cooler in the summer and warmer this winter
what did you do today?
cool
i had another exciting day at work
new programming changes 
a few problems but they were corrected for the most part by the programmers
it wasnt as bad as the last change
i just hate when there are problems....oh well
at least i didnt have to do the programming or testing
how is the babysitting going?
ic
gives you lots of free time this summer which you need
not fair :P
i am jealous
you do have a couple of months before tha t happens
so i am still jealous
especially of the sleeping in
that is what i try to do on weekends
:)
i have missed talking to you
i know
i am sorry
i am not playing a game
i didnt mean it to
i just didnt know if i could get away.  turned out i couldnt
ok
>:D<
:)
my dinner is almost ready:(
i need to go
i will be back online later but i am not sure when
yes, of couse.  later gater
bye
hi, i hope you are staying cool in the heat.  it is 100 here
hi kaycee, are you staying cool?
i am sitting in front of my window ac now
i am glad you do
yes, it was quiet
i did buy a few fountains and lit them
too hot to do much
i went around in shorts and a t-shirt all day
no, i had to get up at 5:30 for work
yea, i only go when the 4th is on the weekend
no, i did a little work around the house but mostly did nothing
watched a little tv and played on the puter
was just lazy
i know :(
i am down to 197 as of this morning
yes, i am still on it
i saw a classmate and he did a double take when he saw me
said i looked great
:)
i kind of thought so
i want to do the diet for another 2-3
weeks
not totally, but it is nice to be off my meds
all but allergy
i am off insulin for my diabetes, blood pressure and cholesterol
not right now
maybe after i go off the diet i might have to but i hope not
i just have to watch what i eat as usual
less potatoes, carrots and bread
once in a while they will be ok
big time....i love spuds
and bread
what did you do today?
make sense to me
i get off work about 2:15 tomorrow for the weekend :)
i like the extra half day
yes it will
makes the regular week long though
work till 5 on fridays
makes the afternoon seem long
kind of like detention at school.....
jk
sometimes it does
probably another 17-18 years
yea, but then i get to retire
an ooold man
jk
that is true, maybe i will win the lottery
yes it would
but i dont think my luck runs that way
i think of the good that i can do and also what i can do with it
donate to charities and travel
i think i could like traveling a lot as long as i came home once a month or so
yes she would, i would have to wait until she is gone
i dont think she would like the travel much
that is true plus she is a \"scaredy cat\"
yes she is
she is very goofy at times
even seems scared of me when i walk by sometimes
she will look at me and then get a funny look on her face and then run
in more lately
although she goes out first thing in the morning
i think about 10
not positive
she still talks a lot when i first come home
i think she tells me about her day
she is cute most of the time
sometimes she is a pain
but not often
never has, i think she wouldnt know what to do with a bird or squirl if she caught it
ok
front
top
side
middle
bottom
:D
who me....???
:-/
na
goofy, yes....silly no.
