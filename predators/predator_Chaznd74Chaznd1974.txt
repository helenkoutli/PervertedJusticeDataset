hello how are you doing tonight
doing good
just looking for people to chat with
watching some tv
what are you up to
33 male fargo
ok
numbers
its a cool show
its a crime drama on cbs
they use math yes, but you dont have to understand the complex math they use to like the show
they go way beyond my understanding of math, and I love the show
so what do you like to do for fun then
I am pretty good at it, but its not my best subject either
i took calculus in collage
biology is my strong suit
i consider myself pretty smart 
wish I could have understood chemistry better
and phsycology
so what are you thinking about taking up in collage
ok
history is cool too
I like watching the history channel at my parents place when I am over there
ok
I was not very good at geography in highschool
I tried to get my parents to let me take ap biology
they did not think I was ready for it
then I get to collage and ace the class 
cool
I tutored biology during the genetics portion
I am a welder and spray painter
I had problems with chem
and then I had a daughter
had to start working to support her
11
she lives with her mother most of the time
I get to see her still
I get her every other weekend
I could not immagine not spending time with my daughter
your dad does not want anything to do with you?
I am sorry to hear that
I love my daughter
I take her fishing and camping during the summer
we work on my parents garden together
we started putting up duck houses
we do lots of things
I am a good dad 
I am planning on taking her camping out at bismark this summer
go to the dakota zoo
where are you at if I may ask
ok
I have been in dickinson befor
went through there on my way to a wedding in Montanna
stopped in dickinson for the night
that was when I was still with her mother
my daughter was about 1 1/2
6 years
makes for a lonely life
I dont know, i know I could never trust her again
she left me for another guy
I think she was seeing him befor she left me
yes
and ty
I am one of those who cant even cheat in my dreams
I agree
I know I got hurt realy bad by my ex
I was in couseling, and group theropy
on antidepressants
we had been together for 8 years
ty
I still deal with depression some
but I am on meds, so i am feeling great now
yup
the only thing I dont like about the meds is I can have a beer every now and then
I dont drink often but I do like a beer every few months
but no alcohol with the antidepressants
its ok, I know the reason I cant drink is the same reason I am feeling so good
the occasional beer is not worth how I was feeling befor
yes, everyone I know is happy I am better
this is a nice chat
just too bad for me you are too young...lol
no but you are young enough to get me in trouble if we dated 
no, not many people do
well I usually try and find a camp ground that has a swimming beach
and things to do near by
we go fishing too
at night we have a campfire and roast marchmellow
you might get to go someday
ok
you need to get a bf that likes it then
my daughter loves it
for me its alot of work, but I still enjoy it
Child's name removed by La Victoria is starting to help me with the work
getting the campsite set up, doing dishes
and some of the cooking
I get to borrow a camper this year
a lady my mom works with
her and her husband bought a brand new pop up
she told my mom they wont use it alot, and we could borrow it anytime they are not using it
yes it is
now I just need to find a gf to bring camping with us
yes but it seems not many women I meet want to be that lucky gal 
yes it does
they all seem to have bfs or are realy big, cant have kids anymore, I am too old for them or something
I mean women that are very over weight, and they have already had all the kids they want to have and have had thier tubes tied
I am of average size
5' 8" and 165-170 lbs
there has to be some physical attraction there at first
and I still would like to have more kids 
but your right I have met some women who I did not care about thier size
a few not many
and they already were seeing someone else
true
and as far as age goes, I dont care about age, its just a number, but not many young women feel that way 
I am a nice guy as you have probobly figured out by now 
but they dont seem to want to give me a chance once they find out how old I am
thank you
you seem like a nice girl too
your welcome
yeah, we all try, but mistakes are made
its human
so what do you like to do for fun then
cool
fishing camping reading cooking swimming gardening woodworking riding bike
watch movies
sci fi
mostly
what was it? do you remember?
have not read that one
I read alot of star wars
yes I am a star wars geek and proud of it
I dont dress up in costume though
no jedi robes or storm trooper armor
I have read most of the books
no I dont
classic rock
stuff from the 70s 80s and 90s
some newer stuff is good too
not much though
Nickle back
I have not heard much of the newer pop music
I listened to pop during the 80s
she has the bratz cd
and yes she has heard of hannah montana
watches it every saturday morning
ok
I have heard one or 2 songs by Alisha keys
those are good
she has a realy good voice
I like to sing occasionally
go to karoke
ok
bob segar
seagar
his most famous song I think would be old time rock and roll
or turn the page
more than likely, alot of shows like to do a skit from a movie that has that song
Just take those old records off the shelf
I'll sit and listen to them by myself
todays music aint got the same soal
I like that old time rock and roll
I also sing Tom Petty, simon and garfunkle
no
my voice is not as gravelly
it smoother
its
I have sung some country too
and I have been tempted to sing pat benatar
although I could never even come close to her voice 
I am pretty decent
and never taken any singing classes
yup
and unlike most guys online I dont talk about sex all the time
as you have figured out already
yup
you are cool too
type of girl I would like to date
yes
your welcome
you seem like a very mature girl
your welcome
you just live accross the state from me, and I dont think your mom would be too happy with you dating me
yes it does
it would take me half the day to get out to you
ok I cant remember how many hours of a drive it is
from fargo to out there
I drive 65 to save on gas
even though I drive a subaru
got 28 mpg on the way back from wisconsin last summer
cool

although, I should warn you, she will be expecting you to sleep on the same bed as me 
like her moms bfs do
no
I dont mind
wondering if you did
we can have seperate sleeping bags on the bed
yes we have a couple of months
your mom lets you stay up late on the weekends it seems
I see

my gotee is more trimmed now and hair is shorter
ty
ty

I am ok with a few extra pounds
and I have met some girls that I wanted todate besides thier wieght
my grandmother is over wieght too
yes but not decent ones

I took them a while ago
one girl I was trying to get to know and date wanted to see 
I have been thinking about deleting them
yes I know
ty
I should have cleaned up after work, but I was not planning on going anywhere tonight
I would turn my cam on for you otherwise
yes
thats what I took that pic with
I can tell you realy dont care if I am a little bit dirty from work hold on it takes a bit to start up 
ok its up
ty

thats ok
I like having a cam to show people what I look like
and its nice to see who you are talking with when you are talking with them
yeah, parents worry about what their teens might do on line 
I have a realy hot gf

yes it is
we were realy good together
she was part of the immagine program
a cultural student exchange program through the theatrical arts
yeah
lucky for you my ex could not stay faithfull 
yes, I have been single since she left me
ok
well if we make it till we are a leagal couple, i think that is a good decideing factor if we are going to make it 
you should try to go to collage at NDSU when you graduate
cool
my dad got his educational degree there
my sister got her phd at UND
and my brother is waiting for a teacher to retire from MSU befro he finishes his music education degree
I am trying to write a book to pay to go back to school
sci fi
its about an after life court
it has the potential to be a seiries of books
and if the first one does well it will be a series
sure
I can figure out how to write one of them like that
have the central charector run into a young love he had during his first life
he'll have an inner debate on weather to complete his mission or pursue her
writing is something that comes pretty easy for me 
i still suffer from writers block occasionally
maybe
I think I might try and get a laptop next year with my tax returns so I can write when away from my home computer 
yup
like when out camping and Child's name removed by La Victoria is still sleeping
get up in the morning start my coffee and write, and drink my morning coffe till she gets up
true
but if you are sleeping too
I can write
I dont think you would be in the way
last summer I was realy wanting a more mature conversation by the end of the week
like we are having tonight
so do I
yes
why wouldnt I be
ok, your last bf must have treated you like shit
so you dont think real highly of yourself
its ok, I will treat you better
you will feel like you are worth while
more than worth while
ty
I can think of some things you could do to make me smile, but that can wait 
lol
sorry, was thinking perverted for a bit there
ok
sexual thoughts, never mind
like i said that can wait
too early to talk about that stuff
Dakota Fence
the company I work for
its a construction company
yup
they give us 5 free shirts a year
so we have nice shirts to wear when customers are around
I like to let the girl set the pace of the relationship
as far as sex goes, making out, things like that
I dont like to seem pushy 
being a gentleman that way
I dont think so
I always think the girls are the ones that want to wait
so if you feel the same way I do, we might never have sex
lol
I am getting tired now though
I should go to bed
going to help my dad work on the boat tomarrow
and maybe plant in thier garden some
they live in north fargo
I live in south fargo
about 58 blocks
no 60
or so
no
in the same town anyway
I have walked up to thier place

the leg cramp
it went away right away though
ok, are you going to be on again tomarrow?

I have a hot young gf now
yw
I was looking online at campgrounds out by Bismark, and found the patterson lake recreation area in dickinson
its a little over an hour from Bismark but it has more of what I like to have in a camp ground
hope Tori is ok
its good to hear Tori is ok.  I spent the day helping my parents with thier garden yesturday.  We have a little bit more work to do today.
Today we are planting the tomatoes and flowers.  My mom wanted alot of tomatoes this year, we have 12 plants.
TTYL hun, bye
Hello bree
doing good
I planted the tomatoe plants today at my parents
and the parsnips
yup
So now I have thier entire garden planted
my mom just has to plant her flower beds
I think she is going to wait to do that with Child's name removed by La Victoria
or my nieces
and I got my laundry done today
yup
I missed  you too
I was thinking about you all day
did you tell your friend Tori about me then
ok
why would it make her sad?
because of her cancer?
that is sad
I am sure once she is over it, she will get a bf too
I had a friend is high school that had cancer too
he ended up getting a bone marrow transplant
yeah it depends on the type of cancer
I am sure her doctors are doing all they can
yeah, thier blood types have to match as well as some other stuff too
not yet, I get to see her next weekend
i was tempted to call her yesturday
tell her that some of the plants we planted have started to come up
some radishes are poking through and a couple of kolerabis
I love gardening
watching the plants grow
I would have to say radishes
yes
I love them
always have
even when I was young and thought they were spicy
I kept eating them because I liked the other taste besides the hotness of the radish
I like most veggies
not all the fond of parsnips and beets though
whats your favorite veggie
yup those are good
my parents dont have a big enough garden for them though
they need room to vine out
we do plant one called a lemon cucumber
sometimes
it trains well along fences
I learn from my parents
my dad is realy good with plants
and knows alot about different varieties
we planted 15 tomatoe plants this year
9 varieties
Chocolate cherry tomatoes, super sweet 100 cherry tomatoes, yellow pear, improves whopper, big boy, jet star, beefmaster, amish paste, and roma
improved whopper 
we have 2 varieties of beans
2 of radishes
2 of corn
I want to get a house real bad, so I can have my own garden
but another 6 1/2 years for that
in an apt
2 bedroom
yes she does
when i dont have to pay child support and insurance I will get a house
but those 2 alone are almost 800 a month
thats pretty much a house payment
yeah I will be taking home alot more when she turns 18
I might be able to afford a house at that time
yes
I stayed up till 9;30 last night, but at that time my medication was kicking in pretty good and I just had to go to bed
I was hoping to see you on last night
I know
thats ok
you are her rock during this difficult time
I know what it is like to be the rock for someone
a friend of mines daughter has muscular distrafy
or how ever you spel it
spell
yes espeacially when she first came down with it
dad
ok, I was going to go back to my parents place for supper tonight
he was just calling to tell me they were taking off for a bit
they are going to be close to my place in a bit

I like you for who you are
we should have a good relationship then
yup
and then in 3 years we can come out with our relationship

I was graduating from highschool when you were born
yes I graduated in 93
1874
1974
what town do you actually live in
I know you said near dickenson
yeah typo
ok you live in dickenson
or on a farmstead nearby
as far as I have known farmers dont realy have a look
do i look like one?
because my family used to farm
so what did you do today then
yummy
ok
what movie
ok
I have not seen that yet
I liked the pirates quote on your profile page
I have them on DVD
i loved the last one
Richards did a great job as jack sparrows dad
he realy had the pirate look down
I cant think of the guys first name
he is in the rolling stones
his daughter is denise richards
I want to say he is Michael Richards
yes she is
was married to Charlie Sheen
she was a Bond Girl
she was in the movie Starship Troopers
its a good action movie
the second one sucked though
I have both of them
maybe one day you can watch them with me
one weekend when your mom is working 
I can drive down to see you and we can watch them
yeah
you pretty much take care of yourself then
what is your brother studying in collage
cool
I like politics
I was in student congress in high school
no i dont want to enter politics 
although I have been tempted to run against Earl Pomeroy
but I like to pay attention to politics so I will know how I want to vote
I know what you mean
I was 4 days shy of being able to vote the year I turned 18
that was when Clinton first got elected
I would have voted the same way the rest of the state did
no I would have voted for Bush
the first Bush
I voted for the second one twice too, but I am regretting the second one
Collen Powell is who this country needs as president, and he is not running
I know I am not the only one
everyone I talk to about that aggrees
it does not seem to matter wether they are demecrat or republican
I want to start an email campaign to try and convince Powell to run in 2012
yup
if this nation would ever elect its first black president it should be powell
he is a real leader
Not obama
yes I agree
unfortunatley there are alot of people out there that want to vote for Obama just because he is black
i think she will be happy
she know I am lonely alot
and she will be happy I finnaly have found someone
and she will be excited to meet you
yeah, that would be difficult
I will have to drive out to see you in June
yup
it doesnt matter
take a walk and visit in a park or something
I know I will be getting a room when I am there for one night
it would be along drive back
a long
nope
yup
and I am not expecting you to sleep with me that night
that would be too soon
I think it probobly would be
but we will have to see how our day together goes
do you know if patterson lake has fish in it
ok, you dont go fishing then
ok
I could bring my fishing rods and maybe we will do some fishing
I have my lisence already

befor she plants that one
I can remember all the differant kinds of flowers
but its a mix of purple, orange and yellow
I know she is planting deep purple morning glories in the front

the only thing I dont like is my trunks filling up with air
have to squeeze the air out and it makes that big bubble 
kinda looks like I farted
lol
I cant wait to come visit you
I have never done that
I could keep you awake
I'll kiss you everytime you start to nod off
yeah
niether can I
of course ask me anything
not all of them
read a number of them
yes I know
you talk about your friends in them
and your family
and that guy you liked
I know
yeah
you like me now
yes you kissed his friend chris
back in april
I am not worried
you are with me now
I trust you
sorry kinda watching tv
welcome back

ok dear
call me later if you can
I will come back on in another hour or so
ok
bye
:-*
>:D<
Hey baby, I am back now
cool
how was supper
what did you eat?
ok
the comedies I usually watch were boring
so I was watching a documentary on FDR
yup
yes he was
not many people at the time knew it
they hid it well
and the supreme court was against many of his reforms
the country needed it at the time
I did read on your blog that you are having problems with algebra
yeah that will be good for you
I never had troubles in algebra
my head is good with math
yeah, I was the first person to finish my finals in algebra one and two
its ok, not everyone has the head for the more complex maths
my brother in-law is one that realy does
yeah
one sister and one brother
my brother in-law could not take anymore math courses after his freshman or sophmoore year in highschool
he had finished collage calculous
so what you up to now
ok
how many choices do you have
alternate between purple and blue
ok
I keep looking at camping gear, even though I have pretty much all I need
thinking about getting some pie irons
have you seen those electric sandwich makers
for making grilled cheese
ok, well for the pie irons, you can put a couple of pieces of bread in them with your choice of filling and cook it over the fire
you could use a fruit filling or cheese, even make pizza pockets with them
yeah pizza is good
I wish i could find the recipe for a good pepperoni
yeah i had one in a spice mix once
sandles should be enough
we could take a walk
i will just have sandles if the weather is nice
so do i
I took my socks off already
yeah i dont like wearing shoes because i cant find ones that fit well
wide thick feet
I have an 8 1/2 eee shoe size
normal feet are d in width
after that is e for width then ee, eee, eeee etc.
so my feet are pretty wide
thats good
easier to find shoes
my dads are wider than mine
he has 8 1/2 eeee
yeah
I am the only one that got his wide feet
my brother has normal feet 
and so does my sister
but they both got his thinner hair
I got the thicker hair
my work boots are the worst for finding
they have to be steel toe
and that pinches if it is too tight
ty
I think you are just fine too
I have been thinking about shaving the gotee off
but not certain yet
I have had it for over 6 years
yes
of course
ok
I do have braces on my teeth
but am getting them off soon
yes finnaly getting my bottom teeth straightened out
they were a mess
another couple months I think
I am looking forward to getting them off
tired of getting food stuck in them all the time
breads are the worst
did you have braces
yes 
ok
thats good, they hurt when you get them on and get adjustments
yes, soft foods for a few days after every visit
and i mean realy soft foods
burgers are too tough
ok
do you like fish?
ok
Child's name removed by La Victoria loves it
and I do too
ok
I will bring some of my homemade hot dogs camping
they kinda taste like a wrangler hot dog
I had to substitute some spices, but have found them since then, so next year they will be better
do you like brauts
I make my own
I am going to have to get 10 pounds of ground pork and make some more
I made 10 pounds in march and that is almost gone
it would be nice to cook some of those over the fire while camping
still painting your nails?
ok
I should get going to bed though
yes we will do that
I'll bring some cheese hotdogs those are Child's name removed by La Victorias favorites
yes I have to get up at 5
and its 10:16
yeah you are 1 hour behind me
kinda wierd considering we are in the same state
must be wierder for people in bismark and mandan
only the river seperating them
and they are one hour apart
yeah
if you lived in one and worked in the other
true
but anyway baby, I do need to get going
I will talk to you tomarrow
good night
yup you too
:-*
hello dear
it was pretty good
I got some work done on that handrail that has been giving me problems
I got my parents handrail built most of the way
and I started on another project that I will finish up tomarrow morning
how was your day
oh no
ok
have you taken anything for it
you probobly just pulled a muscle
that sounds like a good idea
I would give you a massage if I was closer
I have nice strong hands
just wanting to help you feel better
did you just get home from school
thats a good idea
elevate your legs when you do
I pulled a back muscle once when I was in swimming
during a practice start befor a meet
I pulled up too quick
yeah I had to sit out the meet
laying on my back, with my legs on the bleachers
that sucked
but it worked, my back straightened out
how was the weather out there today
cool
it was sunny here too, but we had a bit of wind
got up to about 60
cool
real nice weather then
I wont be on till later tomarrow then
we should have that weather tomarrow
and I am going to grill
too much wind today to grill
I just have a charcoal grill
its hard to get started when it is windy
do you and your mom grill
ok
what type of grill does he use
you dont know if its gas or charcoal
gas
easier when its windy
you have to add charcoal every time
but with a gas grill sometimes you have lava rocks in it
or other flavor rocks
yup its a gas grill
propane
charcoal I think has better flavor
gas is just mor convieniant
my mom likes charcoal too
my dad cant tell the differance
does your moms bf live with you guys
ok
he is just over alot then
ok
I am so glad you were on yahoo the other night
in room 2
I am very happy to have met you
sorry
I like to think of you coming here sometime
I think about you alot too
it would be nice if you could spend a week here
yes
that would be hard to work out though i think
yeah, figureing what to tell your mom
about where you are going
that would be more difficult for me, considering I work all week
where are they going?
oh wow
if you could figure out a way here, after they leave, I could easily bring you back
I dont know
not in the middle of the week
if I left right after work I would not get there till around 9 my time
8 your time
then if we left right away we would get back here around 1 am
and I have to work at 7
I would not get much sleep that night
but if it is on a weekend I dont have my daughter I could come down on friday after work
no, I am sure you dont drive yet
do you know when they are going to leave?
I could check the calender
ok
let me know when you find out
maybe we can have a weekend together
if they arent going to be back till sunday
that would give us friday night, sat, and then sunday till I have to leave or they get back
doing homework too?
ok
what are you thinking
ok tell me about it if you want too
well I am planning on going to see you on the first weekend in June
I dont think I will be shy
and your back will get better
were you afraid I was not going to come see you
why?
ok
well dont worry
I am going to see you
I want to kiss you
yes
I realy want to
yes
I promise
that is one of the first things I want to do when I get there
I will pick you up either at your house or somewhere else we can meet
and as soon as you get in the car I want to kiss you
is your brother moving back home for the summer
ok 
where is that then
ok
do I get a nice big kiss when I get there
good
I am looking forward to them
I think about kissing you too
yes I do
you should not have that low of self esteem
I am sorry if I talk about food too much
I was thinking about getting you more into the music I listen to today
I think you would realy like some of the bands
Journey for one
they have some realy great music
good love songs
I can slow dance
when I was in school I was more into the metal music of the time
so I was into head banging
I had long hair after I left ROTC
but I always liked the slower stuff too
Roxette is another good singer
its just one person
She went by the name Roxette
her big hit was Listen to your Heart
I have been thinking about us and love songs from my time
yes
I do
if i did not have my daughter this weekend I would be driving down there on friday night
Bree I can wait to meet you
cant
dont feel stupid
does your computer have speakers?
google Journey
listen to some of the songs I think about when I think of us
or Pat Benatar
she
she is another singer from the late 80s and early 90s
ok try Pat Benatar "Shadow of the Night"
Shadows
one of my favorite songs of hers
Invincible is another realy good song of hers
trying to think of the names of some Journey songs
I can hear them in my head, the music anyway
ok
I will talk to you later then
Take care
Kisses
:-*
:-*>:D<:-*

so school went well today
are you getting ready for finals?
cool
how are they going
thats good
what finals have you taken already
how did the algebra final go
thats good
I am almost finished with my parents railing
I had a dream about you last night
about our camping trip
laying in bed with you, curling up behind  you
yeah it was nice in my dream
I am looking forward to it
and I was thinking about you when I was grilling
thought about how it would be nice to pull down my loveseat camp chair and have you sitting next to me
just sitting there listening to music, waiting on the food, kissing
how was last night with your moms bf
nothing for you to do over there?
I missed you too
I wonder why she takes you with
one bad thing happened today
I hit my thumb with a hammer
its just bruised real bad
yeah it hurts a bit still
I twisted my back a bit too far today too
just normal stuff at work for me
at least no bad burns yet this summer
no I just have the pic I sent you
I am going to have to ask my parents if I can get some of the pics from thier digital camera for my computer
do you have any more pics
hi dear
do you have anymore pictures
that are on your computer
I know you broke your camera
I think I have seen 4 pictures

I will have to wait till I see you
looking at your myspace page now
gummy bear salesgirl?
5' 2" thats nice

lol
still planning on going to your friends this weekend
thats good
its supposed to be a nice weekend here
I think my dad and i will take Child's name removed by La Victoria fishing
from the weather report I heard today the rain is going to miss us
yup
my dad was telling me I might have to replant the peas 
a thrush was going through where i planted them picking the out and eating them
a thrush is a bird
in case you did notn know
i think we all are going to have to take a nature walk when we go camping
yeah, and you and Child's name removed by La Victoria can ask questions 
yes I am sure
I will answer any questions I can
I will bring along my field guides to help me Identify plants and birds
I do have other pics, but they are of me naked
yes
you can understand why I have not sent them
yes, and I am not going to 
well if I could send them without getting in trouble for it, I would just open photo share again
I know
I need to talk to Child's name removed by La Victorias mom so I can switch a couple of weekends
I want to trade the first weekend in June for fathers day weekend
I am supposed to have her for fathers day anyway
I might as well take her for the whole weekend
that way my mom can see her too
she is usually working the weekends I have her
I was flirting on line with a girl, long befor I met you, I have not talked to her in months
hold on a min
bathroom
ok, I'm back
yes I dreamt about you
I think my metabolism has spiked again 
how much I have eaten the past couple of nights
last night I ordered a large pizza
ate the whole thing
tonight it was 4 steaks and a package of instant potatoes
I eat more than anyone else I know
and I am not a big guy
my brother is smaller than me
of course he does not do manual labor or eat like I do
my friend that has to loose wieght I told you about
I eat about twice what he does
I plan on putting him on a diet along with the workouts
and i am going to have to start eating more than I already do
because I will be burning more calories
you realy dont need to loose any wieght
that sounds nice
it will be good for your back too
I have to remember my metabolism is not normal
I was just thinking, "because of one piece of pie?"
I'm getting hungry again
trying to think of what else I can make
I usually cover my pie with whip cream
Child's name removed by La Victoria does not like whipped cream
what is your favorit pie?
pumpkin
and then strawberry/rubarb
my moms family is big on pies
you should see the line up at holidays
I have tried about every type of pie there is
banana strawberry pie is good too
we will be going to the dakota zoo
last time I was there I wasnt even in school yet
kinder garden
I was only about 4 or 5 years old
so I am not realy sure what is there either 
I like zoos though
so does Child's name removed by La Victoria
next year when we go back to wisconsin I plan on going to the zoo in madison
I have 3 things planned for that trip
so far
the zoo, a duck ride, and Noahs ark
yup, we will stay at mirror lake again
and I plan on reserving the campsite in January
yeah I reserved it in Feb last time
and alot of sites were already taken
it would be nice if you could join us for that trip, but thats going to be a full week
yeah
you would be fine dear
the only bad thing about my meds is they make me tired
I dont mind not being able to have a beer every now and then
but I could do without getting tired this early in the night
espeacially when I am talking to you
and when we are together, I would like to stay up a little later
so I can kiss you longer
maybe i will take my meds after we have smores
I have to take them after I eat something
I should bring fresh fruit and cream camping
that sounds good right now
strawberrys, blueberrys or peaches
we might have fresh strawberrys in the garden by then
from the garden
actually I might be able to take some fresh veggies with me
beans or peas
there will be
Patterson lake has a swimming beach
yup
so can I
I will be prepared 
sunblock
and I will be sure to bring a camera
I will bring you a disposable camera that you can take pictures with and develop
yup
I am sure Child's name removed by La Victoria will take pictures of us sitting next to each other
just give Child's name removed by La Victoria your camera
she can take the picture
yes
i will talk to her about it this weekend
I get her for 3 days this weekend
extra day because of the holiday
I am happy when I get more time with my daughter
I should go though, realy starting to get tired now
yes, I am sorry
I will have to do some baking this weekend so I can eat something befor I go to bed and take my medication later
so I can talk to you longer
good night honey
kisses
:-*
hello
yes its me
the yahoo ID I was using was stolen
I tried checking my mail this morning and I could not get into it
yes
I made a stronger pass word this time
did I logg on again?
ok
yeah that was me
between right after eating and going to bed
yes
trying to get everything back to the way I had it
ok I think I have everything reset now
going to have to cancle my debit card
I cant remember if there was any emails that I got from buying something online 
not taking any chances
I finished my parents handrail today
yup
they should have it completely done and in by the end of next week
yup
how was school today for you
thats good
that thrush did not eat as many peas as my parents thought he did
yes they are
I am glad I rememberes your yahoo ID
yes it would have
you would have been wondering what happened to me
but I remembered so we can continue our relationship
yes I would have
I was very frustrated this morning
because this is the second time my yahoo ID has been stolen
the first one was loboer eating and going to bed
yes
trying to get everything back to the way I had it
ok I think I have everything reset now
going to have to cancle my debit card
I cant remember if there was any emails that I got from buying something online 
not taking any chances
I finished my parents handrail today
yup
they should have it completely done and in by the end of next week
yup
how was school today for you
good
that thrush did not eat as many peas as my parents thought he did
yes they are
I am glad I rememberes your yahoo ID
yes it would have
you would have been wondering what happened to me
but I remembered so we can continue our relationship
yes I would have
I was very frustrated this morning
because this is the second time my yahoo ID has been stolen
the first one was lobodc2000
I know
I had that one for years
There is a friend of mine that lives near chicago that I have not been able to talk to since then
I have been wondering if her bfs parents approved of her or not
he is from India
and they still have arranged marriages
he had told her they might not because of religious differances
religions should never be a factor
I agree
alot of people dont though
I follow a god and goddess
yes
I am not christian
I used to be catholic
the god and the goddess
they dont have names
well in some religions they do
but not to me
I will call them my lord and lady
I accept all faiths
they are all the same, except told from a different point of view
since I became wiccan I feel more spiritual
you got quiet
ok
you do not have a problem with my faith do you?
thats good
no I dont have a problem with christianity
Jesus was a great man
one of the greatest teachers of morality our world yas ever seen
has*
Gahndi was another one
I wish muslims would pay closer attention to the teachings of mohammed
he said Christians and jews are to be tollerated and respected
because they are people of the book
there was a time in the middle east when christians jews and muslims all got along well
any religious book
Mohamed felt that pagans were the one that were to be converted by the sword
people who followed mulitiple gods
yes I would be considered one
because I follow more than one diety
I follow 2
god who is the heavens, and the goddess who is the heavenly bodies
it does not matter
there is not one religion that is right for all people
that is why there are so many different religions
look at how many different christian religions there are
the sad thing is many wars have been fought and are still fought over religion
what ever you believe is right for you
you should never try and force someone to believe what you do
that was a long conversation on religion
I had to look back up to see what started it
3 day weekend coming up
whoo hoo
what?
really
where are you going
ok
her bf taking you
well that kinda sucks for you then
ok
are you thinking you will have new pics by the end of the weekend?
that would be cool
I just had a thought
I have a spare web cam
would you like me to mail it to you?
ok
that would be a no then
I need to pore myself something to drink brb
ok
have you thought about what you are going to tell your mom when I take you camping
have one of your friends cover for you?
ok
its good that you have friends that will do that 
so what are you going to have for supper tonight
that sounds good
did it rain there today
we are now expecting rain tomarrow night or saturday
hopefully it doesnt befor I get a chance to fit my parents railing
I would have liked to take Child's name removed by La Victoria fishing on saturday
I guess I will just have to play it by ear
brb bathroom this time
okback
so what is on your mind tonight
ok
what you thinking
yeah that is going to be nice
did you ever look up any of those songs I told you about?
cool
what did you think of Journey
yeah
I was just thinking about pulling out Child's name removed by La Victorias cd player and putting in a pat benatar cd
yup I did
pulled out her player and now I have music
yup
the current song isnt a love song though 
I will change that
much better song
Shadows of the Night
ok
We're running with the shadows of the night
so baby take my hand we'll be alright
surrender all your dreams to me tonight
they'll come true in the end
welcome back
I was just typeing the chorus of that song
and then put up a pic of you as my desktop background
ok I am back now too
you were not on, so I went and made supper and watched some tv
uggly betty
I decided when it first came out to check it out
and I got into it
so what did you do when  you lost power
computer problems?
get booted?
that could be
so what did you do during your power outage
how did you boil water with no power?
ok
a salad sounds good
yummy
I should get some cucumbers when I go to the store
so do I
I need to make up a grocery list
ok I wrote down the things I could think of right off the top of my head
groceries
for this weekend
I should start getting a few things for camping too
starter logs are one thing I need to get for my summer camping trips
I can pick up a box of them
I have been thinking about getting camp lights too
camp lights are strings of lights to decorate your camp site
yeah
the ones I like look like lanterns
yup
I might get a couple of those and one string that looks like an old airstream camper
I cant wait to be done with work tomarrow
3 day weekend, and I get to fit my parents railing
I get to see my daughter this weekend
she is going to get a kick out of how much of the garden is up already
yup
I dont know what else we are going to do this weekend
but we will think of something
I should check out todays paper and see what is going on around town this weekend
I will have to do that tomarrow at my parents place
phone
ok I am back
a buddy from work
thats ok
thats another thing I will have to bring with camping
I will have my coffee, and you and Child's name removed by La Victoria will  have cocoa
do you use water to make yours or milk
I usually use milk
I think it makes it creamier
ok
I just use a little sugar in my coffee
I would put maybe one or 2 sugar cubes in my coffee
I use sugar cubes when camping
works better than loose sugar
then grahm crackers and a bag of small hersey bars
smores
maybe go to best buy this weekend, try and find a cd of good love songs
yup, find a good cd of songs to slow dance to
yeah, and when Child's name removed by La Victoria goes to bed we can turn the volume down and kiss while listening to it
yeah
it will be realy nice
mmmm...that sounds realy nice
I do too
yes
I do
I think about kissing you and holding you
wondering how you will react when you feel me getting hard when holding you
I will kiss you deeply
and when we go to bed I will just curl up behind you
and hold you close to me
yeah
go ahead
when my penis gets hard
yeah
kinda wondering how you will react to that
not saying you will see it
but I am sure you will feel it pressed up against you
you have not had a bf get hard when holding you?
ok
yeah that will be nice
yes
you can face me and kiss me when we are lying in bed together
you did in my dream
I would too
yup
you got a bit curious in my dream too
you reached into my shorts
you wanted to feel my penis
yes
like I said, in my dream you got curious
I would not ask you to do that, but I wouldnt stop you if you did
yes for real
why, had you been thinking about that?
reaching into my shorts 
thats ok
thats ok
ok
your smile faces made me wonder
ok
I thought you were curous
phone again?
ok
you can ask questions you know 
what ever you want to know
whatever you might be curious about
ok
if you ever think up any questions you can ask
I know, but you can learn by asking questions
true
baby, i should get going to bed
its getting close to 10
need to brush my teeth and everything
I know, I will miss you
I will leave you messages everyday
and you can call me too
ok
good night dear
sleep well
yes I promise
yes i will talk to Child's name removed by La Victoria tomarrow
yes i do
I will show her your picture too
yes
she will need to find out befor we leave
why delay
so anyway, I will tell her this weekend
I will only tell her your first name
besides Jones is a pretty common name
besides you live in dickenson I live in Fargo
not much chance of that happening
I can explain that I have someone who might be joining us
and i cant see me not liking you 
your just worried because of your low self esteem
dont worry
I like you alot
yes
I can feel myself falling for you more and more everytime we talk
you are a wonderfull girl bree
you are welcome
and thank you
for being you, and for filling a void in my life
this may sound wierd, but I want to see the back of your head
I get these visions every now and then
I can remember having one shortly after I started seeing Child's name removed by La Victorias mom
it was of her pregnant
she was wearing this shirt that said when she was due
and it came true
well I had another of the woman that is going to be my wife
I was grilling and holding our son
and she was pregnant with our second child
I only saw her from the back
all it was, was her giving me a kiss
I can only realy remember the back of her head
so thats the reason I want to see the back of your head
yeah
yes it would be
yeah, I need to get to bed
I will miss you too
I wish you could join me in bed, but we will have to wait for that
I wont lie I do think about sleeping with you and making love to you
yes we will sleep together then
I think about it
and yes at that time it will just be sleeping
although there is a part of me that just wants to just go with the flow when we are kissing
I do too
you make me feel happy too
just curious, do you think you will reach into my shorts to feel what it is like 
if you want to
I wouldnt mind
but I need to get to bed
gnight dear
its ok
yup
have fun this weekend
:-*>:D<:-*
kisses
hey hunny, I miss you, had a good day at work, Child's name removed by La Victoria is staying with my parents tonight
I will ask her tomarrow about camping
I talked to Child's name removed by La Victoria today, and she would like to have you camping with us
its a realy warm day today, having Child's name removed by La Victoria try on her swim suit from last year right now, to see if it still fits her
she says its not too tight, I think it kinda is
well I was hoping to take Child's name removed by La Victoria fishing today out by valley city, but its too windy, its also a cold day out, I miss you, hope to chat tonight after I take Child's name removed by La Victoria home to her mom
hey hunny
how was your weekend in montana
thats great
Child's name removed by La Victoria and I had fun today
this weekend
went to see the new Narnia movie today
yes it was realy good
we went to a park yesturday for a while
went out looking for camo shorts and a swim suit for her
couldnt find either
her suit just barely fits
she is a growing girl
she will deffinately need a new one next year
and I guess the camo shorts are out of style this year
she still wants them
thats cool
its too bad her cousins did not have any last year
my first cousin had twin girls
they are a little bit older than Child's name removed by La Victoria
she gets to go through thier clothes when they out grow them
yup
she is playing with her bratz dolls rightnow
in about 20 min we will eat, and then I have to take her home
some left over homemade pizza
ok
what did he do this time
not very nice
yeah
I dont know what the age is when you dont need a parents permission
I want to say 16
no that would not be good either
nice
where in Montana did you go?
ok
what hotel did you stay at
I have a great aunt that lives in billings
and I have an uncle that lives in lewiston
but a belly button piercing is cool
its the only thing besides the ears that I like pierced on a woman
not the nose, not the tongue, or anything else
I have a tatoo, but no piercings
a scorpion
its on my right sholder
I'm a scorpio, that why I picked that
I like it
I will have to show it to you later after I take Child's name removed by La Victoria home
yes I did
I have been thinking about you all weekend
yes, when I was at the park yesturday with Child's name removed by La Victoria I wanted you there
when we were out shoping
when I brushed her hair after her shower, I was thinking about how bad I am with putting hair things in her hair
brets, and hair ties
things like that
I am sure she will let you put them in her hair when we are camping
she will put hair ties in occasionally
whe just likes to have someone else put them in
but I need to get going and get Child's name removed by La Victoria something to eat
I will be back after I take her home
she just likes*
ok
bye hun
kisses
hello hun
yes
I have been back for over an hour
I have been waiting for you to come back
its ok
how is she doing
ok
how is her weight?
is she severly underweight
and how tall is she?
thats realy light
she is badly underweight
well how much do you weigh then if I may ask
thats good for your height
but she is realy light
she should weight around 120 or 130
I am 5' 8" and weigh about 165
I missed you alot this weekend
wanted you with me all weekend
I cant wait to see you
and kiss you
I was curious this weekend when I was looking for swim suits with Child's name removed by La Victoria, how do they size those for women
I mean do they take into account cup size
ok
i know what that can be like
trying to find clothes for Child's name removed by La Victoria
and swim suits are kinda like that
she likes the 2 piece suits
easier for her to go to the bathroom
yeah
true
I have tan lines
watching a little tv right now
I should turn it off
brb
ok tv is off
I wont see your tan lines though
well do you think i am going to see you naked?
true
you'll get to see my tshirt line
and I suppose in a few years I will get to see the rest of your tan lines
yes I would want to
would you want me to
that is a few years down the road
till then it is just heavy kissing
I will too
yes realy
just out of curiosity what is your bra size
yes
I am kinda odd among men, I like smaller breasts
yes
I just dont get the big boob fasination
I came up with a little philosophy about breasts
breats on a woman are like deer antlers
once they get past a certain size all they are is decoration
I have a friend that is a stripper, i was talking with her and her husband one time and told them that
they thought it was hillarious
it came up because she was thinking about getting implants
her husband and I both told her she did not need them
yeah, he agreed with my philosophy
she did not go and get implants
I do like you
yes realy
we have alot in common
and just enough not in common 
you are a nice girl
polite
you like family
you dont mind that I have a daughter already
you dont care about age
these are all things I like about you
your beautifull too
your very welcome
you care about your friends alot too, as do I
one guy I know said once that I dont have friends, they are all family
because I treat my friends that way
I do too
and I am likeing you more every day too
yes
the only problem I have with your age is that the law says we cant be together for another 3 years
so its not realy your age I have a problem with its the law
i do too
it wasnt that long ago when couples like us were common
older men could date and marry young girls
hold on phone
ok
I agree with you
no, your not
and I want to kiss you and spend time with you too
yes I think it is too
but that is the liberals screwing things up
I think you are a wonderfull girl, I am very happy you are my girlfriend
I have been thinking about going hunting out west this fall so I can see you
so would I
I just have to see if i can afford it
I am falling for you bree
hell with it, I am going to say it, I love you 
I have been wanting to say that since a few conversations ago
yes realy
I am too
and i cant wait to fall asleep holding you in my arms
so what do you wear to bed usually
summer
I will usually just wear my underwear
or nothing
but when camping i will wear shorts too
because of Child's name removed by La Victoria
yup
its up to you
tank top and shorts is ok
I wear lounge pants and a tshirt in winter
yeah I like them
yeah
why wouldnt I be
ok
I am having naughty thoughts about it though
yes
thoughts about sliding my hands up your tank top
or sliding your tank top out of the way a little
like I said naughty thoughts
have you been having naughty thoughts too
well simalar to mine
or are you thinking about it now
ok
I had to make adjustments
I have been getting hard, and it was a little unconfortable
yes i am ok
nothing
my penis was getting hard so I had to move it a bit
hello dear
your welcome
would you like me to hold your breasts 
yes, but I would like you to want me to as well
theres lots of things I would like to do, but how much we do is another matter
well I would like to make love to you
yes realy
oral sex and everything
would you like that?
we will have to see once we are in bed together
my god my penis is hard right now
yes
is your pussy getting wet?
does it feel wet?
ok
have you ever masturbated befor?
ok
is your computer in your room or out in the open
do you want to reach down and feel your pussy
ok
thats fine
ok
so what else did you do this weekend besides swim
thats nice
cool
did you and your mom go shoping at all
did you get anything
cool, what did you get
cool
nice
I hate to cut this short, but my clock just told me its 10 I need to get going to bed
I need to be up at 5
yes, it sucks
I am happy too, its a relief to me
i love you bree
I wish the laws were different
yes we do
but if that love continues to grow like it has, its going to be along time till we can be married
yes we will be
yes
I love you for all those reasons
good night baby
so do I
I love you too
I will too
talk to you tomarrow
I just got home
yeah the guy that was going to help me at my parents had to work late today
I was fitting that hand rail today after work
yup
I just have to fill in some welds some more and grind them down, then paint it
yeah, I get alot of practice right now
helping my parents out
and work too
doing things like that at work
I helped my boss build his house
yup, he did most of the work, but I spent alot of hours up there helping him
there is alot of his house that is my work
I sealed the base of the house for him
painted all the railings in it
helped him insulate it
lots of stuff
how was your day
I missed you too
yes
I was thinking about you alot too
when I was over at my parents place waiting for mike to get there, I kept wanting him to hurry up
so I could finish what I had to do there and get home to talk to you
what did you have for supper tonight
I had part of a grilled chicken breast at my parents place
I figured I would have left over pizza when I got home
home made
pepperoni, canadian bacon and sour kraut
have you tried sour kraut on pizza
its the only way Child's name removed by La Victoria likes it
and she loves it on pizza
yes it smells
and I am not too found of it just cooked either
I like it on brats and pizza though
you should
never know if you'll like it till you try it
my grandmother always made us try a little bit
if we didnt like it we didnt have to eat anymore
I used the same idea with Child's name removed by La Victoria
she became a better eater that way
all she wanted to eat befor was mac and cheese and cheese in a soft taco shell
or anything with cheese really 
ok
welcome back hunny
your welcome
just a few more day of school left for you
I dont remember that
yeah
Child's name removed by La Victoria gets done at the end of the week here
yup
I get to see her again on thursday
tomarrow I have an eye appointment
get my new perscription and order my contacts
just regular contact
acu view
I still wear my glasses
I just want to be able to have sunglasses
I have light sensitive eyes, and sometimes my glasses dont darken enough
my welding helmet is 2 shades darker than most people
I had lent it to another guy at work the other day, he had set it to a shade 9 and I weld on 12
I put my helmet on today and started to weld without changeing it back
my god that was bright
I went and talked to him after I got done welding, asked him in the future if he barrows my helmet to please set it back to 12 when he is done
he said,"my bad. I will do that next time"
yup
so what is  your favorite flower
those are nice
what colors do you like them in
cool
I had seen some realy nice roses once called fire and ice
they blended from white to red
perfect blending too
realy pretty flowers
have you seen them befor?
ok
so what did you do today then
how is she doing
thats good
is she eating
thats good
you have not updated your blog in a while I saw
ok
busy with studing for finals
yeah, we tend to talk for a few hours every night
but thats good
it means we get along well and enjoy each others company
and we dont talk about sex much, that a bonus because it means we have something deeper than that
yes I agree
kissing and making love is part of a relationship, but it should not be the main thing in the relationship
and for us it isnt the main thing
we have so much more than that
and I am sure we will have more in common still once I introduce you to camping and fishing
I am certain you will enjoy them
and hopefully you like wild game meat too
well deer meat for one
ducks, pheasant, grouse
yeah kinda
except bambi was a movie charector
and I dont shoot the young ones
and killing them quickly and thinning out the herd is better than letting them get over populated and starve during the winter months
yes I enjoy watching them too
but I also understand the management aspect of things
ok
its what I studied in collage
you wont have to see anything 
yes
I will take care of all that at my parents place
with the garage door closed
my mom and I usualy do all the butchering
I dont know how long it has been that way
anyway, I will have to bring some marrinated steaks camping 
do you like fish
ok
I know
yup
Child's name removed by La Victoria and I shared a cucumber on monday night
I know, I went and bought a couple of them last weekend
yes I like them alot
so does Child's name removed by La Victoria
the entire garden is up now
except the parsnips
they are slow to come up
the beans popped up this last weekend
yeah it wont be long now till we are enjoying fresh veggies
for all of us
yeah, you will get to enjoy them too when we go camping
I'll bring some fresh beans
that would be cool
if the farmers markets are open with lettuce, I will have to get some for salad
sure
my right eye is hurting some
not sure, it might just be dry
its what happens with my eyes, when they get too much light
its just a normal check up, but I plan on asking for some realy dark sunglasses
yes 
hoping I can get some that are as dark as torching goggles
they are goggles I wear when I have to use a torch to cut metal
but I sometimes like to wear them outside, espeacially during the winter
I was at the devils lake ice fishing derby this last winter, by the time it was done my eyes were realy hurting
I went and got some goggles after that to wear outside
they help alot during the winter
although people ask sometimes how I can see out of them
yes they are
brb I need to find my medication
ok I am back
ty
so what are you doing right now
ok
my mom made rhubarb pie today
have you ever had rhubarb
wow
most people up here have tried it
ok
my family is big on baking
all of my aunts, my mom, cousins of mine, my sister
my grandmother still bakes
no you wont, we like to help others learn
I have had cousins who's wives did not know how to bake when they first got married
yes I do
food is a big part of my family
its part of what brings us together
its the center of holiday gatherings
you should have seen the line up of pies during christmas at my mom's family
just about any type of pie you can think of
lately christmas has become more individual families
now that most of my aunts are grandmothers
we still get together occasionally
had a big family reunion last summer
125 people
it was a hot day too
kids had a water ballon fight
it kept them cool
I got to fill balloons
I did some
i hit one of my aunts with a water balloon
and some of the kids
I would play fair though
i would catch the ballon they through at me
and throw it back at them
wouldnt play fair*
just noticed I did not spell that right
we plan on having a reunion every couple of years
maybe next summer  you will get to go
they would not mind
some of my cousins brought thier bf or gf to the reunion
I am glad I am your boyfriend
I do love you
so if our feelings continue to grow, do you think your mom would notice an engagement ring on your fingur 
your friend might though
friends
ok
yes deffinately
thats is how we all want our relationships to go 
to hopefully find someone to spend the rest of your life with
yes
yes
to have children with
raise them
yes
grow old together
deffinately
yes I agree
I purchased a new engagement ring about a year after Child's name removed by La Victoria's mom left me
I was looking for something for Child's name removed by La Victoria when I saw it
I figured it was the engagement ring I wanted to give the woman I was going to marry
yes
sure
I have it right here
its mainly white gold
it has a 1/3 karrot round diamond in the center
with 4 smaller diamonds 2 on either side of the main diamond
and 2 bands of yellow gold after that
it is beautifull
I kept my ring and still have it
its put away in my dresser
well I shouldnt be wearing it
I am not sure
I suppose I could sell it or try trading it in on Child's name removed by La Victoria's earings 
no
I did at one point
but not anymore
I could never trust her with my heart again
yup
she cheated on me and devistated my life
it took me a long time to recover
I think I will try trading it in on Child's name removed by La Victorias earings
yes I am sure
I got over her
that is part of it too, but I did not love her befor I met you
I need to get going to bed now though
its just after 10 here
I will talk to you again tomarrow
I love you
kisses
>:D<:-*>:D<
have a good day baby, I miss you
I miss you hun, hope you are on tonight
hey baby
missed you today
how was your day
it was good
I got the bumper posts painted, and out of the booth, primed a hand rail, and got some posts in the booth
going to prime the post tomarrow with my parents handrail, and paint them
my eyes are good
they got a little bit better actually
I got a trial pair of contacts
and I ordered some new glasses and sunglasses
same as my current ones
just getting new so they have a warrenty
and the sunglasses are black
grey lenses
they wrap around well so I wont get much unfiltered light in
once I get my flex money to pay for them it wont take long till I get them
going to order my contacts next month
it is money that is taken out of my check for medical and dependant care expenses
if i dont use it I loose it
I flex some every year
flexed the money to pay for my braces
I put aside money for a new hearing aid every 5 years
those things are spendy
I have one and it costs $1000
the good thing is I dont have to have all that money in my flex account to use it
once I start putting money into it I can access whatever I elected to flex that year
it helps pay for things 
yup
that money is taken out of my check so I never see it and dont have to worry about saving it
I would too if I didnt have it set aside
thats why I do it this way
it will be nice if we ever have kids
I can flex some of thier medical expenses
and day care
what ever might come up
set aside so much and hopefully use it all and not anymore
if not we make payments to the clinic
the clinic we would take our kids to
most doctors in fargo work for 2 clinics
hold on phone
telemarketer
yeah
this was quest
trying to get me to sign up for stuff
so what did you do today
what did you find to take camping
ok
do you have a bathroom bag
bathroom bag, something you can put your soap, shampoo, toothbrush and stuff like that in
ok
do you have a small bag to take you clothes and towell in to the showers
that works
Child's name removed by La Victoria has a beach bag that she uses
I will make sure to pack one
do you want a wash cloth too
ok
yup
we will have sunblock too
you can or you can share Child's name removed by La Victorias
its either watermellon or bubblegum flavor though
I will be in the other bathroom
no I can give it to you so you can use it
I have extra tubes of toothpaste too for that matter
yup
yes
it will be great to have you along
I will have someone to cuddle with at night
yup
its nice to cuddle up with Child's name removed by La Victoria by the fire too
but I dont get to cuddle up with her when I go to bed
i will get to cuddle up with you at night
hopefully somone will be there to take a picture of the 3 of us together
I miss vacations like this one
ones that are more like a family vacation
last time I took one I was still with Child's name removed by La Victorias mom
that was over 6 years ago
I am going to enjoy having my daughter and the woman I love together with me
on vacation
yes
have you sitting next to me on the camp love seat
with my arm wrapped around you
just on differance
one
I will be kissing your lips
not just your head
and when we go to bed we can continue to cuddle and kiss
I will like it too
maybe let our hands wander over each other as we kiss
wake up in the morning and kiss some more while Child's name removed by La Victoria is still sleeping
I will just put my coffee on first befor we start
so it can brew while we kiss
then after breakfast we can go to bismark and go see the zoo
and see what else we can do there
go to the mandan indian village
then go back to camp and go swimming and or fishing
have supper, play some games, and then have another campfire
roast marshmellows
hotdogs
we will have 2 nights together
so am I
I am realy going to like it when you graduate, so you can come here
yes, we could live together then
yes
I love you bree, of course i would want to
this morning on my way to work i was thinking about the oil fields out there
they are hiring welders at realy good wages
yes
30-40 an hour
thats more than double what I make now
but moving that far away from Child's name removed by La Victoria
I just dont know if I could do it
I am sure I could live in dickenson
I am still thinking about it
the extra money would more than pay for the gas to travel back to fargo every other weekend
but if something were to happen to her while I was out there
and of course I would still get to see her for 2 weeks during the summer
its a hard desicion
yes I do love you that much that I am thinking about moving out there
if I could get a job on the oil fields
it would also help me save to go back to school
bree you are the second most important person in my life right now
the most important is Child's name removed by La Victoria of course
its is something to think about
it would be realy nice to see you everyday
have you come over to my apt everyday after I get home and shower
if things realy start to go well between us maybe befor I take my shower, and then you can join me in the shower
yes
I like to shower together
Child's name removed by La Victorias mom didnt
yeah she said it made her feel like a gold fish
I dont know
I thought so too
but she did not like showering together
I think its kinda romantic
I am going to try to come out soon
i dont know
its something I have to think about, and talk with some people about
my parents for one
Child's name removed by La Victoria for another
so I have some thinking to do
i think it would still be this summer if I did
yeah, I keep thinking about the money, and seeing you
Child's name removed by La Victoria is what is keeping me here
I know
I love you too
you know I have my daughter to think about too
and you understand
thats important
I think about my hobbies out there too
lake sakakawia is not that far
for fishing
and of course there is patterson lake
and pheasant hunting out there
bully pulpit golf course
I might be able to buy a house out there for a garden with the extra money
yes
I know
you just dont want to help me take care of my deer after i kill it
and i can understand that
I grew up around that stuff, you didnt
have to see how you react to seeing me fillet a fish
ok I will do all the cleaning
keep in mind that fish have no pain nerves
there are lots of things out there to keep my interests as far as the outdoors are concerned
and you are there too
I'll just have to make sure i dont distact you too much during the school year
so you can study and do your homework
we'll have weekends
yeah, after I get used to it again
its been a few years since I have had to do it
I am good at math
you shouldnt have that many more years of math though
ok
yes it is
I wonder how much I could save up over the next 3 years
collage
so I can finish my degree
finish my wildlife management degree
yeah, I want to start working in that field
instead of welding
I know I would be, its my passion
I will still have my cell phone so I could call Child's name removed by La Victoria
I have to talk to my parents and Child's name removed by La Victoria
I dont doubt I could get the job
I'm a certified welder
ok
wb

I worked everyother weekend and every other thursday

yup
this weekend I am hoping to go fishing
yeah, head out to valley city and lake astrabula
what do you think you are going to do
yeah
how long has your mom been seeing him
ok

because he does not treat you well
yeah
yeah
you have a bf that treats you well
yeah

I was thinking about that but was trying to think of another one
yeah
I am hoping that I can take my parents handrail over to them tomarrow after work
in a month and a half we have out camping trip
yes it will
yeah
ging swimming together
going
yeah
holding each other close in the lake and kissing
so do i thats why I thought of it

what file were you going to send me

so what do you have planed for tomarrow
sleeping in, visiting tori or beth
ok
yeah, I will be thinking about you alot too
yes
I think about you when I get up in the morning too
thats why I sent you that message this morning
your welcome
so if we get married, do you think your mom will approve of me enough to come to the wedding
ok, thats good
we'll send your dad in invite too
should send him an invite anyway
ok
yes
its going to be a long month and a half till we go camping
yes it is
sure
where would you want to go
puerto rico
its still in the US
no passport needed
no I have not been there
I would suggest Dysney world, but I think we should bring Child's name removed by La Victoria if we go there
I suppose it also depends on what time of the year it is
not realy, just a simple ceromony
and then a nice reception
the reception is the big thing I think anyway
what about you
ok
yeah, so do I
yeah
yeah
I would want to make you happy too
yeah
thinking still and getting tired
about the move
thinking how it would be nice if it does work between us
we end up getting married, having children
yeah
thinking about that vision I had, of me holding my son
I would want to name him Travis Harold
I like the name travis, and harold is my middle name
it was the name of the man I knew as my grandfather
my dads father was killed in a car accident when my dad was 8
my grandmother remarried
and he wanted to adopt my dad and my uncle, but they did not want to give up thier last name
so do honor him, they gave me his first name as my middle name
and my cousin got his middle name as his middle name
and Darren gave his son his middle name
its a way of honoring our grandfather
and I kinda like the name jocelynn Kaye for a girl
I just think its a cool name
but names are something to discuss when the baby is on the way
but harold is a deffinate middle name for my son
you can understand
thats good, but I do need to go to bed baby
I will talk to you tomarrow after I drop Child's name removed by La Victoria off

ok, I could camp out that weekend too
just bring the tent
unless you wanted to stay at the hotel
up to you
its our first official date, so you choose
hotel the first night I am there thats for certain, I would be tired after working all day and then driving out there
too tired to want to set up the tent
so I will just check into a hotel that first night for certain
dont know about the second night yet
if I pick you up befor I check in you can watch tv while I take a shower, I will need one yet
if you want to
yeah
or if you are feeling curious you can join me in the shower...;)
its up to you

I deffinately would like it, because I do love you
but I want you to be comfortable with it too
I love you too
seeing me naked
so you want to join me in the shower then
yeah, we'll go swimming too
if it is raining i am sure the hotel will have a pool
no I was talking about the lake

hopefully it doesnt rain
yeah
I do too
long passionate kisses
yes we can

I will love it
yes it is great
yes we do
and if we are still together in 3 years, we will get married
I think we will be too
what time of year would you want to be married in
early summer
no of course not
NDSU has married student houseing
yeah
we could live there
if its cheaper than what I pay for rent at my apt
yeah
thats good
we will have to be an official out in the open couple for a little while
meaning we will have to date after you turn 18 for a while befor we could announce an engagemen
yup
your bday is april 11
yeah I know
its doing good
doesnt hurt as much any more
I have the bandage off right now and am acutally typing with its some
are you going to be on for a bit yet hun, I still need to take a shower
ok
what ever you wear will be fine, I realy have not seen many of your clothes
I guess it depends on what they look like
but both are nice
long skirts are nice too
shorts are nice because they show off the legs
I have always liked the long skirts though
something sexy about them
Child's name removed by La Victoria even has one
I just like them
but between a sundress and shorts, I would have to say shorts
just turning on my webcam if you wanted to see me
have not taken a shower or gotten dressed yet though
true
I am just sitting here talking to you in my underwear 
yup
so what are you planning on for today
hot
cooler after work during the summer though
just to cool off
hold on  min, I need to use the bathroom
ok'
I am going to do some cleaning around my apt, maybe do some baking
going to trim my gottee after I shower
my mom has alot of rhubarb, I figured I can bake some stuff with it and freeze some
you will
I think we will end up being perfect partners
like a good marriage should be
I am too
I love you alot
I cant wait either
I am looking forward to fathering your children, and raising them together
teaching them to fish
teach them to hunt if they want to
right
ok
just rasing them to be good kids
ashy?
ok
I have hair all over my legs so I dont know about that stuff
I sometimes like to shave my genitles though 
I just think it feels good
yup
I just think it feels good when they are nice and smooth
its not just a woman thing, guys shave too
yup
thats ok
dont, your young yet thats why you dont know things like that
not all women shave thier pubic hair either
and some shave it differently
some shave it so all they have is a little strip
others will just trim it short
some will just shave around thier vaginal opening
ok
do you mind if I ask what you do
shaving or not shaving of your pubic hair
ok
just wondering
some guys like it clean shaven
others like just the little strip
ok
girls
the girls I think shave for guys
some guys like it hairy
some will like it just shaved around the opening
I have heard girls it for guys to shave because oral sex in nicer
girls like it for guys to shave because oral sex is nicer then
no hair on the penis
or the balls
oral sex is nicer for the same reason
no hair in your mouth
it also looks nice
shaving also feels good for guys
its a refreshing feeling
I am not sure how to describe it
its just a nice cool refreshing feeling
yup
everynow and then
I have been thinking about shaving again recently
I havent for a few months
you could always shave and see if you like it
well I know I like the looks of a girl with a little strip
yes
no one in perticular
just in general
sorry
didnt make that clear
its ok
yes
this is how you learn too
do you think you will try shaving?
just to see what its like
it grows back
I need to go take my shower though
ok
I missed you too
I cant wait to get there
yeah
I will pick you up, kiss you when you get in the car
go check into the hotel
go up to my room
kiss you a few times on the way up to the room
go into the bathroom and start up the shower
yes, I will have cooled of in the car
get undressed in the room, then go in the shower
get all washed off, and then kiss you a bunch in the shower
then dry off, sit you on the bathroom counter and kiss you some more
order a pizza
yes
I want to kiss you as much as I can
and then we can make out till the pizza gets there
then eat, and make out somemore watching tv
till we get tired, and go to sleep
I dont know
you'll be all full of energy then
excitement of meeting me 
yeah
of course I will be excited
my penis will be rock hard too
yes
then in the morning when we wake up we can shower again
and we will kiss more

and I will hold you close against me
I can wash your back
yeah
let me check out dickinson hotels
I found all of them
yup

I will kiss you alot too
I was checking out the hotels
the holiday inn looks realy nice
yeah, they have rooms with hot tubs
and a water slide

so I am on the upper side of average

I love you
hey baby, I am home, my parents have left, I miss you
hey baby wb
its was good
just visited 
how did you spend your day
ok what movie
cool thats a good one
Child's name removed by La Victoria loves that movie
plan on getting her the sound track for christmas
I could have talked longer this morning, i was waiting around most of the day for my parents
yeah I thought so too
but they went over to my sisters first
played with the kids there
I called them about 430
they were just leaving my sisters and heading over to lowes
so i went out to Fleet Farm and picked up this rhubarb cookbook that I wanted
no its not dumb
I missed you too
and was happy to see you on this morning
and then I have been going back and forth between my computer and the couch all night
checking to see if you were on
and then sitting back down to watch tv
its 9:30 and I have not been tired yet
was planning on using my iced tea pot to make an iced tea blend
but I needed to make more ice first
so I have also been waiting on ice cubes to freeze
I was blending earl grey and orange spice
I am just trying something new
the grocery stores here have lots of bulk tea blens that I have been wanting to try
yeah
they are cheap too
yeah it is
one of these days I will pick one out and make some iced tea with it
I have vanilla and butterscotch
Child's name removed by La Victoria tried it for the first time last time she was here
she liked it
her mother does not like butter scotch
I do though
there are some of her tastes she gets from me
yup
espeacially the ones where it is only my mom, Child's name removed by La Victoria and I that eat them
squash for one
yeah
never had it grilled
but I have done grilled sweet potatoes
we make most veggies alot of different ways
raw, boiled, baked
we grill some things
I eat those raw
ok baby
I love you, talk to you tomarrow
because I will be in bed when you get back
love you
:-*
bye
I ended up working late today, and am going in early and staying late for the next couple days
I am going to bed early hun. I love you.
hopefully we will get a chance to chat tonight after I get home. I should be home around 6:30 your time
I am going in to work early because the gate area at work is behind on thier orders.  I am working out there to get them caught up
hello dear, I just got home
ty, how was your day
tireing
I have been up since 4 this morning
thats what I am doing right now
I think I should just order a pizza tonight
the only reason I am not going to cook is because I am so tired from work
and I still have to go in tomarrow morning early
I know, but its how things have been going in the gate area
the guy thats supposed to be in charge of the gate area tends to be kinda lazy
its nothing new for me to be picking up his slack
I have been doing it for a few summers already
I am getting tired of it though
its because they know I work fast and do know that area well
the shop forman and I used to work out in the gate area together
last night we covered 6 gates in 1 hour 45 min.
yes its good
no one that is out there currently could even think about getting them done that fast
all they have to do is get a good rythum going
its normally not that hard of work
I have taught most of the guys that have worked out in the gate area to cover gates
it doesnt help when they are lazy
we lost a couple of guys in the shop recently
one hadnt shown up for work in over 2 weeks
so he got fired
and yesturday one guy called in said he was taking the bus to work
then called back and said he was sick
pretty obvious he wasnt sick
just didnt feel like working that day
so he got fired
yup
you have to have a good work ethic
it means showing up for work all the time, on time or early, unless you are realy realy sick
and work hard though out the day
its important
employers know who is realy sick
I have one of the best attendance records in the company
if I call in sick, my boss knows I feel like death warmed over
yeah, I have gone into work sick befor, but it wasnt bad enough for me to stay home
yup, its good to get work ethics like that now
there are some guys at work that are alot better than others
I think there are just a couple more guys in the shop that we should get rid of
one for certain
the other he has been getting better
so what did you do today
yeah
ok
I usually go through my closet once a year
how is your brother doing
I think I might look for some more shirts this summer
and maybe one pair of shorts
I wear darker green shirts alot
and tan
that was a ducks unlimited shirt
the other one I like to wear is a muppets shirt
do you know what the muppets are?
they might be a little befor your time
I know they had the new muppets tonight show
ok
I started introducing Child's name removed by La Victoria to them
mainly because I like them still
we went to the library once and checked out the muppet movie
yup
we used to do that alot, check out movies from the library
yeah, its free
I find old movies from when I was a kid, and want to see them again
she ends up likeing them too
she loved dysneys "Flight of the Navigator"
its a cool sci-fi movie
one of the first movies that Sarah Jessica Parker was in
I am going to have to find that movie at best buy or someplace
its a good family movie
we also watched the Laberinth together
she liked that
I have that movie
Dark Crystal is another that I need to show her
oh baby those are good family movies
classics
they use muppets in them
Jim Henson and Frank Oz worked together to do alot of stuff like that
Jim henson was the creator of the muppets
and Frank Oz was another person that did simalar work
Frank Oz was responsible for Yoda from the star wars movies
Frank Oz created the puppet they used and supplied the voice
yes
what was the line
Empire strikes back
I have practically memorized the first 3 star wars movies
yes
and I still watch them
hold on phone
My dad, he had found some old insurance quotes over at thier place
wanted to know what they were
still thinking about it
I am going to talk with my parents this weekend I hope
want to talk to them befor I talk to Child's name removed by La Victoria
trying to think about who I should order a pizza from
or if I should just have a couple bowls of cereal
yeah I think I will save my money and just eat cereal tonight
I am starting to feel more relaxed now
I have generic coco puffs, and honey nut clusters
I buy the bag cereals
I do what I can to save money
there are certain things I will spend extra on, but its because of needing quality
like my cook wear
I am slowly starting to get some more quality stuff thats going to last
I bought a skillet pan recently, it cost me $50
and that was on sale
but it has a 30 year warrenty
yes it is
I am going to start to buy more things of that same brand
next thing I want to get is a small frying pan
then a larger one
although I need to get a new couch or love seat soon too
and chair
my living room funiture is falling apart
its old
hopefully I can get it to last till next winter when I get my tax returns back
then replace them both
there are lots of larger price items that I need to get
or want to
I bought a new computer with my last tax returns
the couch and chair I need to replace
yes the one I have
I could use a new shotgun
when you consider the one I have been using is a very valuble collectors piece
my dads old shotgun
browning arms company quit making it, the value of the A-5 shotgun jump way up
my dads shotgun is probobly worth 2000
yes
and I keep hunting with it
I was turkey hunting with it this spring
it seems like all I use for hunting is collectable firearms
my deer rifle is 109 years old
I looked up the serial number on the springfield armory website
it was made in 1899
yup
all my guns are realy old
and that makes them valuble too
yup
my deer rifle was used in the Phillipine insurection
I also have a M-1 30 carbine from WW II
the phillipine insurection or the M-1
its a US military rifle that was used during WW II, korea, and vietnam
it was retired from service after vietnam
low power
the M-16's round has more power than a 30 carbine round
during the Korean war, it was not unheard of for chinese soldiers to be picking 30 carbine bullets out of their winter parkas
the round did not have enough power to penetrate the parka
it worked well in vietnam because the VC were not wearing as heavy of clothes
but with body armor becoming more prevalent in todays militaries, the 30 carbine had to be phased out
the US military needs something with more power behind it
hold on a min. I am going to pour my cereal
ok
it was a rainy day today here
rained most of the day
I saw my malto meal hot cereal up in the cubbard
I think I might make myself a bowl of that next
yeah, warm me up some more
if you hadnt been on when I got home, I was planning on taking a hot bath
no
I will be fine
I took my wet socks off so my feet are dry now
I will preferr to talk to you over taking a hot bath any day
your much more important
I have 2 sweat shirts on still from work
we cant weld galv pipe with the doors closed
so it got cold in the shop
I will be fine
but I have been in 50 degree temps all day
till now
I'll make my hot cereal befor i go to bed
thats another thing I was thinking of at work
hot cocoa
some of the guys were talking about hot drinks with alcohol in them
I know I cant have that so I though hot cocoa would be good
other wise I might have a cup of coffee with a shot of baileys irish cream in it
I'm sure you havent
but its a nice warming drink
when we used to stay at the hotel in Lakota during dear season, we would eat in the reasturant at the hotel
they have a bar there too, and I would order one
to warm up a bit and relax
it is
you'll have to try one when your old enough
or if we get married, we can have them some nights during the winter
yes I do
I think about you all day long
and about us
yes, realy, when I dont have to think about my work
so how is your brother doing
thats good,going to make myself some cocoa now
ok, I'm back
yummy
I have more packages up in the cubbard

Friday night I am going to make an egg bake with Child's name removed by La Victoria
for saturday morning
you tear up bread into small pieces, and put them in a cake pan or small baking pan
add whatever breakfast meat you want and shredded cheese
then for a full cake pan you take one dozen eggs, and some milk and mix them up
pour this over the bread, cheese and meat mixture
let it sit over night in the fridge

spread this over the top of it
then bake at 375 for one hour
my parents are outside waiting for my flex money check, brb

anyway, I usually add a layer of cheese right at the end of baking the egg bake, just enough to melt on top
I have to call the company that manages my flex account
they only took money from what I had last year nothing from this year
so the check was only 398, out of the 2800 I sent in a claim for
yeah I am going to call tomarrow on my break

just something reliable, that can get you from point a to point b
yeah

I read an article in the paper yesturday that said that rent prices are increasing alot in dickinson
I didnt think you would, not something that realy concerns you at the moment

yup
espeacially when I am thinking about moving out there
so what else are you doing

tell him I said hi
he doesnt need to know how old i am
no
I am sure he will be happy to know that you have a bf
they know I chat with a nice girl on line
have not told them how old you are, they dont need to know
they dont realy believe in online dating
so if I told them you were my gf they would not think it is anything like it realy is
have you told beth I am your bf
or will
alot of people do think that way
I dont think that way
I am serious about our relationship
we love each other
I love you too
I hope you are

I should tell you I do smoke, but I am working on quiting

I had managed to quit for a few months last year
no wait it was the year befor
but I am going to try and get into meritcares stop smoking program
get a little bit extra help
yeah
I am tired of the addiction
I still support peoples right to smoke if they choose, but I want to quit
my antidepressant is starting to kick in
but I am going to stay up for another hour
ok ask as many questions as you would like
I have nothing to hide from you
I love you
yeah I know
I can pick up some protection
befor we go to the hotel
Its not like they would know who I am
its ok
dont worry
its going to be nice just being with you
even if we dont do anything, although we are planning on it
its not dumb, its smart to think about protection
I have been thinking about it too
yes I know
yes we have so much in common
I love you too bree
it sucks that we will have to wait 3 years to be married, but at the same time it doesnt, because we will know for certain if we are meant for each other by that time
yes we will
yes, we are already finding those things out
and I will find out how you like fishing and camping this summer
yes it will be
and we will get to make love again when we are camping
we could
if we can find a private area out there
after Child's name removed by La Victoria goes to bed, sneak off and make love
or we can just make love in the camper
befor we go to sleep and then befor Child's name removed by La Victoria wakes up
yup
are there lightning bugs out there
I think it would be cool for Child's name removed by La Victoria to catch some
not in town
I saw some out at a state park in MN that is close to fargo
we didnt see any when we were there
we were in the dells
although next time we go I plan on stopping for the night befor we get to the dells
so its not such a long day in the car
stop just inside wisconsin and set up the camper
the camper will be easier to set up and take down
dont have so much to pack into the car again
so we could get back on the road right after breakfast
if we get married we should try for a nice long family vacation like that every couple of years
yup
thats what I am doing with Child's name removed by La Victoria right now
now that I have a week of vacation time during the summer
out trip out west is our small weekend one
next year i would like to take her to the black hills of south dakota I think
see mount rushmoore and reptile gardens
the trout hatchery in spear fish
my parents took us out to the black hills
we stayed in spear fish sd
they have a trout hatchery
you can feed the trout
its realy cool
and we could pick you up along the way
I love you too
that will be a week vacation
leave on sat morning
stop in dickinson that afternoon and stay over night
sunday continue on to spear fish
spearfish
then on monday we can go see mount rushmoore
tuesday reptile gardens
find something to do each day
yeah
it will be nice
you will just have to pack enough clothes for a week
yup it will be a nice vacation
I will have to bring a couple rolls of quaters with, if I remember right you have to pay for the showers in spearfish
it was a long time ago when I last stayed there

Child's name removed by La Victoria was asking me why i was not wearing my shoes or sandles in the backyard today

cute story from this weekend
I was helping my dad install a new walk door on thier garage
Child's name removed by La Victoria was outside playing
I had just gong to check on her,when I got back my dad was looking for his hammer, asked if I could see it
It was above the door
anyway, Child's name removed by La Victoria came over and asked because she heard we were looking for something
at this time I had taken the hammer down and it was sitting on the step stool
she asked what we were looking for
my dad, joking with her said his hammer and asked if she could find it
she starts looking all over the place, even looking at the hammer on the step stool
I asked her if she knew what a hammer was
she says,"yes" and points to the hammer on the step stool, then goes to look some more
my dad and I both just cracked up
it was realy funny
hey, I told you about those tomatoes we planted just as seeds into the garden
3 of them finnaly poped out
hopefully they will get to produce yet this year
they are a bit behind
yes, this is the first time we planted tomatoe seeds into the garden
usually we get plants that are already started
yup
the other tomatoe plants we have were already started
and they have established thier roots in the garden now and are starting to grow more
well hopefull I will be able to have a garden when I do get a house
my dad was talking to a guy that is remodeling a house today, the guy is a teacher in west fargo who is doing it just for something to do
I am going to ask my dad if the guy is planning on selling it when he finishes
yes it would be, it has a nice big back yard
its a smaller house but thats ok

thats too bad, but it will go away
yes it is
I make sure I drink plenty of water during the summer
when I get home form work on a hot day the first thing I do is get a tall glass of water
and I make sure I drink 2 befor I go to bed
I know all about dehidration, heat exhaustion, and heat stroke
I have had heat exhuastion a few times
yes
I watch myself realy carefully now
if I start to feel or notice signs I go and stand in front of a fan
there was one day a couple of summers ago, when I left work early, went to my parents place, because it closer
and checked my temp
I was 103
I was overheating badly
I went and took a shower and slowly lowered the temp of the water
yes it is
but i got myself cooled off
thats not good
I got my stitches out today
Its not fully healed yet
I dont know if there will be a scar

pizza hut here in fargo barely puts sause or cheese on theirs
I tend to order duanes or happy joes

holding you close to me in the shower

yes it will
we will get to do that
we can make love again in the morning befor we shower together again
dont worry, just do what feels right
do what feels good
and it gets better the more you do it with one person
you get to learn how the other person moves
what they like and dont like
its just getting to know each other
yup
getting to know each other in an intimate way
I cant understand people that want to try and have sex with as many people as they can and not settle down with one person
thats what I want
so do I
I might have a surprise for you too that weekend
yes
nope
going to keep it a surprise
nope
ok

you will just have to wait
anymore and it would give it away i think

I dont want to give it away
nope thats it
sorry

I am glad you got extra sleep
did it get realy hot there yesturday?
ok
I have been drinking my rhubarb iced tea at work this week
I put some sugar in it
sure
I can bring some with
I will probobly have some with me when I go see you
for something to drink along the way
like rhubarb and tea
rhubarb has its own flavor
yup
I will take a couple water bottles with it in
no
its realy tart by itself
the way I made the tea was perfect, just enough rhubarb and tea flavor
not too sweet
and it is very refreshing
Child's name removed by La Victoria liked it too
yup it is
I have to make more tomarrow night
I am out
yup
I can show you when we are camping
it just takes a while
because the rhubarb has to simmer for an hour
the tea only for 20 min
then it has to cool
yup, you have to cook the rhubarb so it softens up and you can get the flavor of it out
I had a dream the other night that my family opened its own reastraunt
my brother and I cooked, my mom baked, and helped with cooking
and my dad ran the books
I handled the meats
my brother handled fruits and veggies
yeah
my dad thought it would be a cool idea for us to do at one time
when they found out I could cook realy well too
my brother is just starting to develop his cooking
he is getting better
his broccoli salad is realy good
ok
welcome back
thats good though
at least your not dehydrated
I love you
so yes it would be cool to start our own reastraunt
just a little family restraunt
like a cafe
my mom would need someone to pass her baking secrets on to
yup
she would be able to do it forever
although her mom kept doing it for a long time
I dont know
my sister is realy busy, with her family and being a doctor
my brother and I both are not very good at baking
maybe you
they are family recipes
for pie crust, lefse, things like that
my sister helps make lefse
its kinda like a realy flat potatoe pancake
I guess
its a norwigian food
she learned how to make it from my dads mom
and brought it to her family
my mom is full blooded german
my dads mom is norwiegian
its surprising to find someone up in this area of the country that doesnt know what lefse is
we put butter and sugar on it, roll it up and then eat it
some people eat it with lutefisk
thats another norwiegian food
its a fish
cod, cured in lyme, completely dried, so all the lyme is out of it, and then rehydrated
we couldnt cook lutefisk there
my brother is allergic to fish
if we searved fish it he could not work there
pretty much
just the smell is enough to give him a reaction
yeah, my parents are glad I have my own place so they can come over to have fish every now and then
I was about to say the same thing
I need to go to bed so I can get up in the morning for work
I love you
good night
:-*
you too
I missed you last night, I love you
hello dear, I just got home
yes I missed you last night
my day yesturday was ok, it rained most of the day
today it was nice for most of the day
its good
it dried out a bit too much and the skin cracked open
I put some salve on it and a bandaid
my sunglasses are done, I have to pick them up after work tomarrow
go pick up Child's name removed by La Victoria from my parents place
have supper
after she goes to bed I will be on here
just in the evenings
how was your day today
thank you, my time with Child's name removed by La Victoria is important to me
yup
I think I pulled a muscle in my sholder today at work
my left sholder is a little sore
it will be ok, I'll just take some ibuprphen
yup
I was lifting heavy steel today
making some hitch plates for a truck
I am almost done with them, I need the truck now for some hole locations
its ok
basically I need the truck so I can get some mounting holes in the right spots
after that I can finish welding it
and someone else gets to make the bed
our new aluminum welder is pretty reliable for showing up everyday
I am still the back up
I am the back up for everyone...lol
its because I know how to do everything
hold on phone
never mind, no second ring
in the shop?
being a dad, and loving you
my boss likes that I can do so many different things
although I get stretched thin sometimes
I hope I get a good raise this year
I have been doing alot of extra stuff around the shop
and if i do it will mean I can come and see you more often
I talked to someone who used to work out there
he said dont if you value your life, alot of the guys that work out there come to work drunk or high
or both
thats why this guy had quit
if they other people that worked out there were sober I think I would try for a job out there
between the extra money so I can come back to see Child's name removed by La Victoria everyother weekend, and you being out there
it would be worth it
yup
I would give you a key
yeah it would be nice
I love you too
the weather is supposed to change for the better now, so we might go fishing
so do I
I plan on going over to my parents early on sunday morning to cook breakfast
I dont know yet
i was thinking an egg bake and rolls
but my dad might preferr bacon and eggs or sausage and eggs
I like them both
and I made both of them
the breakfast sausage and the bacon
I mixed the seasonings into the sausage, and I cured and smoked the bacon
yes
I told you I make all my own sausage
and I know how to cure bacon
its not hard it just takes a long time
bacon has to cure one day per pound
I cant do surgery
lol
and I am not the best at bakeing
but yes there are alot of things that I do know how to do
yup, and I am so proud, Child's name removed by La Victoria is starting to remember different animals
she sometimes cant remember what type of bird or bear she sees on tv or outside
we were watchin funny animal videos on tv tonight
and I asked her what an animal was
she told me it was a bear
and I asked her what type of bear
she sais a polar bear
she was right
yes it is
she sometimes can identify a duck species
I work with her on it, and I encourage her to ask questions
my dad tells her to ask me
because I know more than he does when it comes to wildlife
yup
my nephew the brain is catching up to me though
wildlife seems to be his passion too
yes it is
I can talk to him about that stuff almost on the same level
but its good because he can learn from me
10
he is a grade ahead of his age
so is his sister
he is in 5th grade
he'll be in 6th next fall
same grade as Child's name removed by La Victoria
all 3 of those kids are brains
but if you look at their parents it makes sence
my sister is a doctor
my brother in-law dropped out of collage, but could go back for one year and graduate with a bachlors in 7 different fields
yeah, both parents are super smart too
something kinda funny
I decided to try out student congress one year
my sister was already in it, and she was in the senate
I got entered into the lowest house
I won that house with a commanding lead
my dad was in the back of the theater when they were giving out award
standing next to one of the other coaches
when they said my name, the other coach said,"oh god,not another one."
Meaning another Lippert in student congress
yes it is funny
I also did some speach
and just like my sister I excelled at that too
my second tournament was EDC(eastern dakota confrence) the qualifier for state
in my speach division, I made alternate for state
yes, they just wish I would have finished collage
my speach coach was extatic
she had asked me to enter so the edc could send one more person to state, she didnt expect it to be me
I only had one tournament to learn how things went with speech
yeah it was great
so what did you do today then
cool
how is tori doing
thats good
Child's name removed by La Victoria and I could look for a hunting pouch for my dad on sat, as a fathers day gift
I got the idea last winter
to look for one for him
I have one and I love it
its a bag that attaches to my leg and waist, that I carry some of my extra gear in
I put my deer tag in it, my field saw, latex gloves, first aid stuff, and wet wipes
I can carry extra shells in it too
no
just carry the rest of the box in my pouch
me I own 3
I have the 2 I told you about and I inherited my grandfathers 22 rifle
yeah, it is also very old
but incredibly acurate
I can remember shooting gophers with it
no
no reason too
thats ok
from what you have told me about your family I am not surprised
my family is into hunting though
so I have guns
I still want to get a couple of newer guns
a new shotgun and deer rifle
because the ones i use are so old and should be put away just on display
I wouldnt mind getting a pistol or 2 also
but they are not a big deal
I had a 45 long colt revolver at one point
I want to try harvesting a deer with a pistol someday
I have been bow hunting a couple of times when I should have had a pistol
because the deer was too close
couldnt even bring the bow up, the deer was walking past me at less than an arms length
if I had had a pistol I could have just shot from the hip and gotten it, no real need to aim when its that close
but with my bow there was no way I could have drawn it back
would have had better luck trying to stab it with my knife
but it was a doe, and she had a fawn with her, she bolted as soon as she got right next to me
she smelled me
and they ran past me and then stopped about 40 yards out
yup
its spots were gone at that time of the year
early in the year the fawns have spots to help with camoflage
the adults have bright yellow or reddish coats
so they stand out more
if a preditor approaches the doe tries to get it to follow her, she can easily loose it once she has led it far enough away from the fawn
thats why the does have bright coats
later in the year the coats turn dull brown almost grey
so both can hide better
animals are my thing
yup
its difficult to actully see fawn early in the year
they stay hidden mostly
I would have to spend an entire day out in the woods to hope to see some
and hardly move the entire time
although Child's name removed by La Victoria and I were lucky in wisconsin last summer
we were walking down to the lake early in the day, and we spoted a doe and fawn
we have them in fargo too
Fargo actually opened up part of the city for a speacial bow season
to reduce the number of deer in the city
some people were complaining about it when it was first proposed, but archers are very good at making a clean kill
so the animal does not suffer
it would still hurt them for a little while, but they die in under a minute
they have enough adrenaline going through them I doubt they know they were hit
can you tell yet why I am the person my nieces and nephew and my daughter turn to about questions regarding wildlife
it just comes naturally to me
yup, and I love it too
its just incredibly interesting to me
yeah, I am
I think I might bring the Yahtzee game camping
yeah its fun
if you want to
Child's name removed by La Victoria is realy good at checkers
yup
we also play this outdoors trivia game called camp
there are different leavels of questions
Child's name removed by La Victoria plays at the beginners level or level 2
I play on level 4
its called Camp
you roll dice to go around the board
if you land on a green set of tracks you get a question
if you answer the question right you roll again
white tracks and its the end of your turn
there are go to club house spaces too
then you go to the club house and read a fun fact
first one back to camp wins
there is a short cut but you have to have gotten a compass quetion and answered it right to use it
probobly
but its fun and educational
sure
I have my phone right here
omg, time flies when I am talking to you
it was nice to talk to you on the phone again
I cant wait to see you either
the week will be over soon though
thats cool
that will be fun for you, except seeing other couples there
thats good
I should maybe bring the camp game so you and I can play that if its raining too
yeah
Child's name removed by La Victoria loves the game
wow we are getting some severe weather right now
most of its passing south of fargo though
in MN they are getting hail and some reporst of cloud rotation

Child's name removed by La Victoria got me a tie died shirt for fathers day

my mom got to be grandma all day today
she was watching my youngest niece
my sister has her other daughter at this diabetes camp
and my brother in-law and nephew were having a father and son day
its for kids with diabetes
I am not sure who puts it on
my sister does and so does my youngest niece
my sister is one of the doctors at the camp
she volenteers for it
yup
its good that there is a camp like that
its something they learn to deal with
yes, they just have to watch how much they eat
they have to watch thier sugar intake
there are somethings they can eat as much as they want
when we are having a family dinner and I make something, I try to watch how much of everything I put in it
and if the recipe calls for sugar I use a sugar subsitute
yes it would be, I get my sugar checke occasionally
checked
it runs in the family
so I watch myself for signs
and have myself checked occasionally
a mixture of powerade and fruit juice
I drink a few of the powerade of gatorades at work, I had a little left over from one, so I just poured in some juice befor I went outside to grill
so I would have something to drink out there
I still need to replace some fluids from yesturday and today
yup
have to keep hydrated
I drank alot of water and a 32 ounce gatorade last night when I got home
thats good
so what did you do today
cool
hold on a min, I need to go put my grill away, the coals should have burned down by now
ok, I'm back
thank you
I have to take this shirt off, the sleeves are iritating my sunburn
better
wearing sleeveless shirts at work to stay a little bit cooler
I cant wear shorts at work
or a tank top
sleeveless shirts are ok though
lots of guys cut the sleeves off thier shirts
I buy them without sleeves
yup, ready to wear for work, no extra cutting
I will be bringing one of my fathers day gifts with me this weekend
Child's name removed by La Victoria also got me a fishing net
its a small one, the right size for pan fish or walleys
bass
I can
I was just planning on catch and release
no
I was just planning on checking in when I got there
just going to ask for a room
neither can I
just a couple more days
no
you'll just have to wait
nope, sorry
no, anything more would give it away
yes I do, but this will have to wait
I cant wait to be with you
its going to be a nice weekend together
thats good
ok
it will all be packed and ready to go
just have to put your bag in my car and head to the hotel
then I can go in and check in
do you want to come in with me or wait in the car for me to come get you to go up to the room
its up to you
do you think anyone that might know you would be working there
ok
I should
I should go get some
yeah I know
I wouldnt want you to get pregnant yet either
I cant wait either
if we end up getting married then we can make love without the condoms
yup
just an itch
I am a bit tired, but not exhausted like last night
yup
cool
do you have a small cd player too?
yeah, my car does not play cds
I know its unusual for a 2001 model
subaru
outback wagon
subaru is the make
the model is the outback wagon
no
its a small station wagon 
green and tan
no
there is some guy driving around fargo in a mustang that color
god that is one ugly car
its not as bad as some of the crotch rockets around town
there are 3 of them that the people put shag carpet on the body pannels
my first thought when I saw the fist one that was like that was,"what was that guy thinking?"
my second thought was,"what does his boyfriend think of that?"
it looked so gay
It was just an assuption
then that weekend I saw another one
the first one had blue and orange carpet on  it
the second one, pink, and white
and it was a guy riding it
well theres the boyfriend of the first guy...lol
I dont like crotch rockets to begin with
those were just ugly
one of the guys at work and I have an ongoing joking debate about crotch rockets vs. cruisers
the different types of motorcycles
which is better
he says crotch rockets are better because they are faster
I say cruisers are better because they are more comfortable
and I still say crotch rockets are gay
I have a cruiser
you'll get one
our debate is mainly just joking around
he is right about crotch rockets being faster
but he admits I am right about cruisers being more comfortable
I have joked around and told him I am going to convert his crotch rocket into a cuiser
cruiser
put some longer handle bars on it, rake it out a little, move the shift lever forward
it means to move the front wheel forward
on crotch rockets its pretty much right below the handle bars
on cruisers its forward of them and the shocks angle back and up
it has to do with phisics which you will learn in a couple of years
ok
basicaly with the wheel tighter to the body of the bike, the center of gravity when turning is in a better position
thats why crotch rockets are designed more for racing
I need to get something to drink
ok
I took an ibuprphen tablet too, muscles are a bit stiff and sore
working so much harder lately
and muscles started to cramp up yesturday too
my sunburn would not like the hot water right now
in a couple of days it will be fine
I will be fine
I should go though so I can take a shower and get cleaned up befor bed
get some extra sleep tonight
i will be here tomarrow night, and you have the whole weekend with me
ok baby

I worked out in the gate area again this morning
in the afternoon I was cutting and drilling some bent pipe, thats for a canopy
then I started marking out steel plates for making posts that the pipe will go over
I have to weld some smaller pieces of pipe to the plates tomarrow
work is slowing down for us
not realy
we have not had that many jobs to work on so far this year
just the gate area
its the only place that is staying busy
I know how to work out there, so I get to work late and help them finish gates
yeah, thats true
true, the shop manager trusts me with his personal stuff
I get to take his company truck to get washed and fill it up
I helped him build his house
he had me go up there to do work somedays and just left me there to do the work
he had work he had to do back at the shop
jobs to bid and such
he would get permision from the owner to let me go up there to work, and they still paid me
yup
I am starting to get some of the fringe benefits of being there so long
I get to make somethings for myself as long as I do it on my breaks
and it does not cost me anything
I made myself a fishing spear
and my parents handrail
yup
the steel for that handrail should have cost me 80
I used some pipe that was left over from a different job
so I didnt have to pay anything for the handrail
but there is only 3 people that know that
my boss, you and me
my parents dont even know
yes he is
I told my parents happy aniversery early
yeah, this was a very profesional job
my time invested in it is alot though
that handrail should have cost around 500
for labor and materials
they needed it
it looks good, my mom thinks it realy completes the steps
ok
I was just grabing the movies
its going to be nice to get out of town and see you
I am sorry
I still want to, of course I do, I was just worried about being able to pay for food and the hotel as well as gas to get there and back
