I've done some jewelry design
Earrings

I do it in my spare time right now
but I have a growing group of people you read my pieces
and they love them
want me to get them published
yes, on the jewelry
was going to start a small company
no...lol
but fair question, I guess
no
not at all
I have no problem with gay people
I'm been good friends with many in my life

well, actually, it was an air matress
but is was real thick
but I now have a futon
I used too
but it's funny, th ebed I mad for the futon is higher than the air matress was, and the female, Ruby Jewel Sparkles (the one on our right), couldn't get up there, so I had to build her some steps
yep
lmao
no, I'm not
A female named her
the other one is Dez
Ruby Jewel's sone
son*
I call her Ruby Jewel
I know
she is so priss!
I live on the 2nd floor of an apartment building
and she will not walk down the stairs
I have to carry her
dez will go up and down...hell, he's a dog
but Ruby Jewel, the queen bitch requires that I carry her
lol
she'll go up stairs, but no down
not*

I can only be on one at a time
wearing*
the necklace is one of my designs
I'll turn on my cam someday...and be a perfect gentleman
and show you some jewelry if you like
or I'll take pics
either way
lol
but what?
:D
night
sweet dreams
perhaps...
hope so
morning?
well, I ended up watching the rest of th emovie
the movie*
I LIKED IT
yeah...it was kind of boring and at the start
but the story ended up being really cool
hmmmmmmmmm
you know, there were parts that were gross
but scary?....i'm not sure
but when the bad guy (lady) received her justice...
:-&
lol
I won't
:)
I was up until 2:00
and the dogs woke me up at 8:30 this morning
I used to be
not too much anymore
real job
lol
but I want to start performing some of the things I've written
I'm a project manager for AT&T
when corporate customers make big changes to their phone systems...
I manage the projects to do all of that
I'm also a SME 
and I help people around the country figure out what's up with their sysytems
AT&T stuff
yeah, I like it...it' ok
pays the bills
lol
yes
but I've done alot of theatre in my day
and I want to start performing them
yeah....wow
lol
you ever do plays?
yes, I love it
it's a rush
the nervousness befor the performance
rehearsals
it's all cool
so......what else do you do?
in your spare time besides softball and making jewelry?
back in PA?
so how long have you been in OK?
Please do!
LMAO
well done
if I were to say "shit"...would you be offended?
ok...
shit...I can't imagine moving from near Philly to a small town in Southwestern OK
I thought moving from there to Norman was bad
well, Norman is a little different
the University is here
and it's hard to describe the effect it has on the town around it
but there are always people from all over the world here
and stuff like that
I've always lived near the university, because it makes the town different
I guess I am
and....Norman's population passed 100,000 people in the 2000 Census
so it's not a tiny town
lol
I'm sorry...:(
not only that, but I'll bet they're all cowboys
:(
Oh, Chelsea!
I'm sorry
shit...that must suck so bad it's beyond words
why the heck did you move out there?
and.....?
good for him?
to move from Philly to Hell?
I don't get that!
lol
I see
what's the drug?
if I may ask
alchohol?
I don't want to pry...perhaps I shouldn't have asked
oh, ok
wow, I'm sorry
well, I hope he can make it out of his addiction
well.....
I wish I could help
but we can chat once in a while
If I was a guy your age down there...we could hang out
lol
and laught at the cowboys and cowgirls
usually there's at least one!
lol....I hope he's around
I sometimes put a status message up that says: If anybody says "Git er Done" to me, I'm gonna shoot them in the face
lol
but I wouldn't...I don't own a gun
never have, never will
yeah....Larry
lol
I'm not much for guns
and I'm not much for hunting
to me if you're hunting with a gun, you're not hunting
shit!
let me finish
if you use a gun, you're doing nothing more than ambushing an animal
if you want to hunt...strip down to your briefs (or boxers), carve a spear from a tree branch and go hunt
make it fair
not an opportunity to kill something from 100 yards
hell no, I don't do that
but do you see my point?
you shoot a helpless deer from 100 yards, you're not hunting
the guy I write about talks about that subject in one of the stories
all of my storied are about the life of one character
stories*
he goes by the name of "Your Humble Servant"
yes
always, in one way or another
I guess I'm being a little coy about it
but I'm not sure whether to offer to send you one
yes
they can be...well, yes
I write horror
and Your Humble Servant is not human
the character...Your Humble Servant...he is not human
I will never label him
if I were to do that, then people would begin to have expectations of him to behave in a certain way
and no, he's not a dog
lol
some people think he's a V..........
a V..........
lmao
yes
LMAO
Chelss....you have a pretty good sense of humor
well, ummmmmmmm
that's can be funny at times
:)
awwwwwww
hey, you said it!
I said you had a good sense of humor..thereby that you're smart too
YOU said you were stupid
/:)
lol
and I don't believe it for a second anyway
/:)
lol
Finally
you either, huh?
well, the stories are not for the faint at heart
and they are rather...adult...at times
not pornographic
but there is an underlying sexuality to his existence
he actually falls in love in ove story
love*
in another he saves a girl
he doesn't go to save her...but it just happens that way
I love that movie
LMAO
in Paris
yes
tom cruise
lestat
have you seen queen of the damned?
Lestat is in that movie
no the Vampire Lestat
those ate bothe books by Ann Rice
here
I had to put a CD on
sorry
well, I write my own stuff...and so it's not like anybody else's
so I tried to go to your Myspace, but it was messing up
lol
I'm gonna try again
perhaps
ok
yeah

well, all of them, actually
if you read them all
:">
thanks
you're kind of cool too
ok....not kind of
you're cool too
and I'm sorry you have to live in a cow turd little town
yes, I think so
I'll bet you still have your Philly accent, don't you?
lol!
that's right
so what will you do today?
LMAO
sounds like a "blast"
of snot
ty, ty
and did you clean it?
or let it dry there?
no doubt!
gross!
lmao
not really
I'm gonna chill
and list a couple of things on ebay
het what?

I'll try not to
lol
I swear
If I were gay, I'd be out of the closet a long time ago
awwwww, thanks
so let me answer your question this way....
Chelsea....I am not gay
lol
No...it's cool
<~~~Laughing
well.....I'm not like anybody else altogether
Stop!....:">
lol
actually, no!....
keep going, I love praise
lol
NO!!!!!!!!!!
:D
I would turn on my cam and show you the dogs, but I look like poo
haven't showered or anything
no, human poo
which is ablolutely gross
and smelly
well, ok
just for a sec
lol
oh no....
there I am
Ruby Jewel's looking out the window
yep...human poo
ok....that's all you get
thanks
:D
I have long hair
to my shoulders
long for a guy
especially a STRAIGHT guy
lol
yeah
in fact most gay guys have short hair
really?
yeah?
y?
I see
did he prance around?
brooklyn accent?
yeah...bullies
hate em
wow
I use that term too
Knuckle draggers
yea
well, monkeys and apes have long arms
and they're "lower" than humans
and they drag their knuckles on the ground
lmao
I also use the term...
mullet sporting knuckle dragger
a mullet is on of thos gross country boy haircuts that short on top and long in the back
have you ever seen the movie Joe Dirt?
he had a mullet
ewwwwwwwwwwwww
so you're over run with Mullet sporting knuckle draggers?
OMG
Chelsea, you poor girl!
I feel helpless
lol
yeah
If I could save you from such a hell hole I would
lol
but you'll just have to cope
:(
but you will
and we can chat sometimes
:D
what about the girls there?
any cool ones?
friends?
That's not what I meant!
Jeez!
8-|
lol
you're hooked on the gay thing aren't you?
lol
:(
when I came out here for college, I cried for 2 weeks straight
and I'm straight
yea..I missed PA so much
well, I got over it
but I had a different situation
well, yes, I did after a while
well, I was in college, on my own, and in a cool town
#-o
I'm sorry...
when that happens!
come to Norman!
lol
well, stop in Norman on your way and say Hi
lmao
/:)
lol
ok...I'm gonna get my day started
shower first
does your head feel better?
p u?
lol
I'll bet I do
<~~~no too bright
I remember now
but I have some cologne
lol
ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh kay
ttyl
have a great day
or try
Done any good reading today?
Hey!
ok
get booted?
well, ok...I won't ask anymore
ok
so what are you doing now?
ummmmmm
sweet
anything else you want to tell?
hmmmmm
nah
I feel weird asking
lol
although I'm curious
:)
ok...shit
you knew I'd break down didn't you?
lol
how many times did you 2 do it?
ok...cool
ummmm
did you perform oral on him?
and did he do the same for you?
WHAT!!!!!!!!!!????????????
now that's not fair!
I'm sorry
he should have
done the same for you
that's the thing about young guys...it's all about them
and their orgasm
the woman is left to fend for herself
jeez
well...it's the friggin truth
I'll bet you didn't
but he surely did
you guess?
how do you mean?
A the female 1/2 of the love making dou has the same right to an orgasm as the guy
and it's his responsibility to make sure she has at least one
women can have many in one love making session
well, that's what foreplay is all about
well, Chelss...all I can say is I hope the next guy you grace with your beauty has enough sense and cares enough to make sure you both climax
dang what?
lol
yes
I think you're most attractive
lol
please don't blush
lol
ok
well, tell you what...I have some things I must do 
I know it's long, but I would be honored if you read the piece I just wrote
no, no, no
Chelss...I'm not mad
it almost makes me blush that you're blushing
No, Chelss
you are NOT stupid
idk...
it brings a smile to my face anyway
no, not at all
it just does
:">
see, now you have me blushing too
lol
yes
the latest on...#8 The Ancient Game
it's the latest
I would be honored

They are!
they like you!
:-O
OMG!

OMG!
I can't believe they'd say that!

YAY
so are we going jelly fishing or not?
:">
:-*

1) I'll protect you from them
and 2) we should be careful
I could "accifentally" make a pass
yeah, that too
never know...with these...:-*
yeah, and kisses
in general
but it would probably earn me a smack
lol
well, I hope not
but you never can tell
you think it would?
I can't think of a reason
can u?
:-*
YAY
kk
me too
wow...I just sat down too
well, where were we?
yea............:((
well, I figured out my next story
ganna write it this weekend
well, it has to do with war
and his existence in time of war
and the dangers
and also why nobody ever finds any evidence of his....activities
yes...wanna know why?
in the city, it's dogs...stray dogs and others
they follow behind him and clean up
yes
in the country, it's wolves and dogs
and this story will revolve aroung humans treating dogs with incridible cruelty
killing them, torturing them
and he will have had enough
and he decides to take them....
but................
the dogs.................
since it is their own kind being abused
they don't wait until he's done
they go with him
and....well....you can imagine what happens
lol
lol
o yes
you have only read one piece
but he saved a woman in an earlier piece
no...he let her go
she was being raped by 5 guys he had decided to "take"
want to read some?
:)
:-*
ok
just a little
well....should you go now?
I want you to get a good grade
and we can do this another time
I will
I'll be on all night...until I go to bed

I'd rather spend some time here with you
:">

:-*:-*
I was actually getting a little worried
that you might have lost power
from the ice storm
it's really bad in some places
especially in soethern OK
:">
ok...I have a confession of sorts
lol
I took out my map of OK
and looked at a 25 mile range from Wichita Falls
lol
and tried to figure out in what town you might live
but I don't know
it's darn near the border, I can tell you that
but , maybe that was wrong to do
but I was curious
I don't know
I guess it wasn't
I don't know, I wasn't sure how you would react to me telling you that
:)
tks
when?
I don't know...just wondering
seeing how far it was
:">
yes
well, I don't know...let me see
more than likely about 120 miles
around there
not too far
not really 
about as far as Tulsa from me...if not closer
:x
yeah...closer than Tulsa
and I drive that in a little over 2 hours
:-*
it's not bad
I listen to music
and pass the time
Honda
Accord
wonderful car
but......
if I ever found myself heading down to see you?
it would take forever!
lol
because of the anticipation
:">
well, not right now
it could mean trouble
lol
I didn't mean "right now" as in not right now
LOL
I know
but it would be trouble as in...
I'd want to give you 1 of these :-*
shit...phone
I'm not answering
ok
and if I gave you one of those...
and you gave me one back....
:">
I'm glad
but who knows what would happen after that
but it could be trouble :-*:x
well, like more kisses
I know
and then kisses on the neck
and holding tight
and....
well....
x
wherever we were...the windows might get steamed up
:">
mite be?...wud be!
but if we were caught...
dang....no fun
and that's where the "trouble" comes in
lol
me too
although....
that's only if we were caught
if we weren't....
I'd be in heaven
you have no idea
how much I wundt wanna get caught
you are an angel
:-*

:((
hi
:">
i took a nap earlier
and when i woke up...
the 1st thing i thought of
was u
lol
yeah...
:-*
i've been retarded too
lol
did you get your chores done?
what did you have to do?
ewwwwwwwwwww...smelly
lol
I don't think, I know
I've cleaned my share of bathrooms in my day
in fact...my bathroom here needs cleaning
thanks for reminding me.../:)
Cleaning lady!????????????
I'm the cleaning lady
I wrot jsut over 1 page
but that page was pretty good
and it's flowing pretty well
:D
have you written in ypur journal?
your*
sweet
the SB?
:(
oh well, perhaps you'll be rescued some day
we can only hope
in a manner of speaking
or a honda
lol
:-$
lol
like I said...you never know
well.....?
nothing
I thought maybe you weren't quite done
wasn't sure
I'll give you one guess
3 words
they start with C, A, and S
no, not quite
close
cold
and
shitty
lol
:D
how about down there?
your closer to the tropics
Sunny warm and dry?
Wo!
brb.....p
better!
:D
all empty now!
lol
Awwww
I was sure you'd want to know
:D
I'm doing laundry right now
just thought you'd want to know
lol
and dryer
that's what sold me on it
the washer & dryer...I do alot of laundry
especially during the soccer season
since I'm a referee
I have to wash my uniforms during the week
especially in the spring, because I not only do leagues on the weekends, but High School during the week
yep
you have a soccer team at your school?
just curious
Refs from up here never work that far out
in the OKC area
and Norman, of course
the HS games are good
the players are skilled, and....
they pay you at the game!
woo hooo
yeah...the leagues pay too, but they send you a check every so often
in fact the league here still owes me $265 from last season
yeah, but I have a good job, so I don't hassle em for it
although I will send them an email
I make about $1,400.00 per season in league play
LMAO!
don't call me a yahoo!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
:D
j/k
oh, hey!
guess what
:-*
:x
:)
:">:x
so when I woke up and thought of you
I have a snuggling image
:">
ummmmmmmmmmm

:">
ya?
and....?
about what?
no
please
:)
please?
pretty please?
pretty please with sugar on it?
lol
no...Chelss...it's just you and me here
:">
ya
you thought of me coming down?
well, I didn't really try to look you up
you just said you lived about 25 miles from wichita falls
and so I just was curious
well, ya, I was
no, go on
please?
beleive me, Chelss...I would never come down there
not right now
but tell me...what were you thinking about me looking at the map
please, Chelss
please don't be
awwwwww
would you want me to come down?
not right now
I said that because ai thought you were concerned that I looked at the map
I*
I thought maybe you thought that I shouldn't have done that
so....
ya?
/:)
:-*
no...not stupid
the weather is stupid
not you
nope
so.............?
no
no
Chelsea T: o no im not mad
in fact................?
:-*
Chelss......
please tell me
you don't have to
and who knowa
knows....
I may
no
Chelss....I would love to come down there
but you know that if we were caught together....
it would be trouble all around
I know you didn't ask me
are you ok?
I hope you're not mad at me
I'll ttyl
:(
sorry
I thought I made you angry earlier
Chelss....
don't be embarrassed
tell you what...do you want me to guess?
or would you prefer I drop it?
what you were thinking
ok
you wish I would come down sometime?
idk
yes
and at the same time...idk 
you know what I mean?
ok
so I know ur no asking...
but would you want me to
no
why would you feel stupid?
and...you ARE cool
not yet
there is a whole life ahead of you
lol
hold on...let me tell them that
OMG
Dez said grrr woof arrrrr woof
which is: Thanks, tell her I thing She's cool too
Ruby Jewel said: Grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr rowlllllllllllllll woof
which is: Damn right, bitch, and pretty too!
I scolded her
shae says she's sorry
she was joking
well....what will we do?
about us
and if we ever meet
the problem is...when I meet you, I'm gonna want to kiss you right away
hoping you'll kiss me back
:D:">
but after the kissing...
well, I wouldn't be able to keep my hands still
you know that
well...:">
nothing
and I could only hope that you couldn't either
and if that were to happen....
we would find ourselves.....
probably
with few if any clothes on
idk
so....wow
we would probably end up making love
and then what would we do?
I mean afterwards...I'd have to leave
LMAO
You have such humor
geez..........:-*:x
me too
I would want to take you home with me
make you happy
but we couldn't
no they wouldn't
what am I saying!?
yes they would
lol
but they would learn to deal
I know
so
so right now we need to do 2 things
chat and chill
if that works for you
Don't tell me that
Because you know I want to make sure you're always warm
and I'll end up in the car...lol
:D
:-*:-P:">:x

it ws for the best
well...we grew apart
and didn't love each other anymore
but we're still friends
ya
she lives close by
and I can see her anytime I want
and she comes over every other Sunday
tomorrow is not the Sunday she comes over
so let me ask you........
ya
your mom
is she around?
do you get to see her?
it may be none of my business
you don't have to answer
we've never spoken of your mom

one*
I don't get drunk
I have, but it's been years and years since I did
well...alchohol tears people apart
I've always said that" Alchoho tears people apart, so the government will make sure it's always legal
but marijuana brings people together so it will always be illegal
I have
I used to all the time
not anymore
a couple of times a year
I would more
but maybe not really
I mean it's ok once in a while

Why "NO"?
Hey...it was a shot

Iwish I had a cloak of invisibility we could use
like Harry Potter

I'm a better kisser
lol
we could do both at the same time
:D
kiss while we're swimming
:">
yes, this would be in the Summer
:">
you could wrap yourself around me and I would carry you in the water
yes
no problem
5' 8"
you?
perfect
I could carry you on land as far as you needed me to
and I could hold you in the water forever
pruney
lol
I used to go there alot
not for a while, tho
it does sound nice
in the water with your arms around my neck
me too
kissing
:-*
:x
holding
:x
being against the other
my heart would be beating so fast
I'm warm all ova!
:">
ya
.......
:-*:-P <~~~lsd&p
in the water
we would bring a blanket
I would carry you out
to the blanket
and we would lay down in the warm sun
ya
lol
not ne more?
lol
:">
:x
we would kiss
and touch
but....
would we bring bathing suits
or.......
skinny dip?
:">
nope

I've never run into anybody else there
well....
I have
u?
I have
:">
yes!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
so we could forget the suits
you think?
well, it you weren't comfortable without the suits we could wear them
but when we got out and on the blanket
if we wore suits would you bring a 1 piece or a 2 piece?
:-*
2 piece then?
:">
so that when we got to the blanket....
and began kissing
I would untie the top
:">
and touch your beautiful...
body
and...idk if I should go further
:">
the description would become...much more erotic
lol

:D
I'm happy and smiling
and at times I'm so warm I want to open the windows! :">
I know
my electric bill will be $1,000,000
and Ruby Jewel WILL get mad
She'll Say: "I'm Ruby Jewel Sparkles!  I'm not supposed to be uncomfortable!"
8-|
yep!
she thinks she is
but there's a new princess
and her name is.............
Chelsea
:-*
:x
oh, jeez, Ruby Jewe is almost 8 human years now
and dez is her son, and he's almost 4
yes
well, we got her for my ex, but she attached herself to me
so we got a male, and he became her dog
#:-S
yep
it was so funny
when we found out Ruby Jewel was Pregnant?
Gretchen said they had to get married
so I was in the import business then, and I called one of my customers...David's Bridal
and asked the buyer I worked with if she could send me a CD of the Wedding March
no, I worked for an import company
I was in the toy business
nope
I imported alot of stuff for Hot Topic, Spencer Gifts, and others
ya
:D
it was
:-*:x
yes, we did
she sent me the CD
and gretchen told me I had to be the preacher
and we set up Deb (my ex) and I's bed with pillows and stuff
and Gretchen gave me a People Magazine
and we had the ceremony
lol
it was so cute
and Gretchen had them kiss
when I said "I now pronounce you doggie and wife"
LMAO!
mine's better
:">
:-*
I'll bet your's is good too
I'll bet
you'll have to let me be the judge someday
:)
everybody still up, there?
cool
so now that we're alone.....
lol
pic of...?
lots
well, not lots
and they're all pretty dark
I'll show you some if you like?
most are troll-like
lol
:-S...ok
:">
I shot all of those myself
I set up the red back drop
put the camera on the tripod
and used the delayed shudder
this ones's from Halloween 2005
the shudder that opens to let the image into the camera
that mask is made of tanned leather
:D
I love Halloween!
We have a costume contest at work every year
:-*:x:x:x
nope...:(
lol
this next one is me in my room
thanks sweetie
you win.......
my heart...:">
my hair was shorter
this is a portrait done of me in the early 80's
it's the flag of the Soviet Union
:-*
well...you have any pics for me?
:((
awwwww
you should take some more and load them onto the computer
for me
:-O
What????????????!!!!!!!!!1111111111
what a bitch!
oh well
I'll bring mine...lol
we can set the delayed shudder and take pics of the 2 of us
:D
but...
we'll put it away when the serious kissing begins
:-*
:x
you gonna go to bed soon?
or do we have all night?
:-*
lol
ok
me too
no...we will stay a little longer
and then go to bed
and I will think of you before I fall asleep
and when I wake up
and I hope...in between
snuggling
kissing
rolling over
lol
I love the way you put just tha "o" when I write stuff like that
mite be nice?
yes...it's funny
ya...I write something like that and you say...o
like...oh moy!
Oh My!
I won't if you prefer I not
not write stuff like that
if it embarrasses you of something
or if you find some things too explicit
:">...ok
then...
lol
Rolling over
lol
1 sec
ok
ummmmmmm
I would roll us so I was on my back
kissing you
and you would be on top of me
ya
ummmmmmmmm
straddling me
kissing
and I would.....
scoot down and pull you up at the same time
so that you were right over my face
and.......
give you pleasure
ummmmmm
perform oral
for a long, long time
well, you will
when we are together
I will stay there until you....
reach orgasm several times
heck yes!
Yes!!!!!!!!!!1
wonderfully
drinking, and kissing, and licking
well....I love it
I love making a woman climax like that
staying down there like 20 minutes
or more
lol
and then we go from there
lol
lol
weird question
yes
well...it's the man's responsibility to make certain that his partner is satisfied
yes
so that both the man and the woman...when they're done, are fullfilled
making love is a 2-way street
it's not just getting "him" off
and she gets a little please before he reaches climax
pleasure*
orgasm
well, for a guy, there's no mistaking it
I mean he begins to ejaculate
but for a woman, it's much more complicated
the female orgasm comes in waves from what women have told me, and from what I've read
you mean the male orgasm?
well, it's difficult to explain, and I don't know what a woman's orgasm feels like to her
but you'll know when you have one
lol
believe me
I guess you haven't either
how do you mean you wouldn't know what to do?
all you would have to do is enjoy it
and release yourself in it
yes
when you feel it coming on...release yourself in it
you'll know
your entire body from your heart to your muscles will all move as one
and you will have an orgasm
you'll have to believe me on that
lol
:">
ummmmmmmmm yes
I've been thinking of everything if we were together
:">
yes....I am...also
excited?
lol
me
r u?
no!
really?
then perhaps we shouldn't talk about it
o
:">
how naughty?
:">
:-*
like what are you thinking?
ya
mmmmmmmmm
ya
and?
ummmmm
lol
:-*
well....
ok
but I'm curious
what else you're thinking
but you don't have to tell if you don't want
ok
I think you would really enjoy it
and when I was finished
you would decide
if you wanted to do the same for me
i know
if you didn't want to....
then you don't
:">
lol
ummmmmmmmmmmmmm
YES
lol
but only for a little while
because
no i do like it
alot
but if i was still on my back
I waould want your hips over my own
and...
enter you
and make love to you
lol
me too
and we would roll over again 
so that you were on your back
yes
lol...no
well...just different positions
wrap your legs around mr hips
my*
/:)
lol... no
make love
enter you
the same
:-*
yes
on the bed
y?
ummmm
y

yes reason
:-*

lets make sure it's "when" not "if"
stupid yahoo!!!!!!
:-*
we'
we'll figure it out
I no
how to be together
it may take a while
no, r u?
i only said that 
because i thought i freaked you out
well...we'll have to figure out how to make it not a bad idea
ok...tks
yes
u?
:">
:x
:-*
ya
but like i said...it may take a while
:-*
well...almost12:30
bed time?
me too
well, sweet dreams
and I'll tty tomorrow
or later today

:-*
Chelss, I don't know if you're there, but either way...Good Morning
:)
hi
good morning
whoops....good afternoon
I well, and rested
u?
I'm*
just ok?
:-O
lol
awwwwwwwww
I've been up since just after 9:00
I hope it was me
tell me about it
I was never good at science
lol
:)
wow...cool dream
whether I was in it or not
can you see my status message?
I've been writing this morning
OMG...
I was writing about war
and went back and read what I wrote
you want to read it?
it will come in a couple of posts to you
Oh know..I love it
but it was...well... just read it, ok?
oh..but before you do....
no, it's not scary
:-*
awwwww. I was gonna send you a kiss first
You did!!!!!!!
#-o
Do!
ok...here it comes
As your numbers and your civilization grew, so did your ability to make war.  As your desires for wealth and power grew, you began to rationalize a devised intrinsic value of domination and conquest.
In your division of labor, you pressed onto the males of your species the responsibility for killing for profit, and a few hundred thousand years later it has become part of their DNA.
From the first moments of their existence, your young males are socialized to prepare themselves to fight wars.  I hope you realize that when you create such a wealth-serving socialization mechanism, you not only prepare them for the possibility of fighting wars, but also create within them the desire to do so.
You place war as one of the constituent elements for self fulfillment.  Once you do that, war ceases to be a possibility, and becomes an eventuality.
:)
I don't think I've ever really gotten to the root cause of war like that before
that when we teach people to be prepared for it, we teach them to want it
and after they start wanting it, it will happen
:-*
I think war is now in male DNA
no...but I think it's part of us
:x
I hope so
soon
or a magazine
you won't have to 
:-*
I won't
who knows...
it will take years to become famous
especially if I perform these pieces
and you can go with me
your hand in mine
where ever
life takes us
one never knows
I've been practicing one of these pieces to perform it
at a local club
every wednesday night they have open mic night
and I'm gonna perform there
when I have everything ready
:x
:-*
yes
Herr Hollrah
that is his name
yes
when I perform these pieces, I will do so as him telling the audience of his life
one night at a time
:-*
well, each of the pieces I write are a srory of one night from his life
:">
thank you, my dear Chelsea
thank you
:-*

8-|
:(
and................
waiting................

:-*:-*:-*
YAY!
:-*:-P:x
HI!

:D
There's a middle school near me and I take Ruby Jewel I Dez over there on the weekends so they can run around without their leashes
and we just got back
the grounds are enormous
and there's a giant cacant feaild next to it
vacant*
field*
and they run and run
Nein, mein schoene
that means "no, my beautful one"
lol
Oh, I almost forgot
:-*:-*:">:x:x:x
:-*:-P>:D<
now careful...I'll start warming up
:">
we got a little earlier
it's all gone, though
now just cold
so I'm curious about something
your Myspace Profile
I'm like the only regular person on your friends list
I little bit
who did?
why?
reported you?...for what?
jsut being too you?
young*
o
how old do you have to be?
so I've heard
so why haven't you re-added your old friends from PA?
they won't snitch
:-O
Y?
ya
ok
r u gonna?
don't worry
ok
all kinds of people do
for what?
from?
hmmmmmm
dang I'm sorry
so your friends won't speak to you because of that?????
:(
wow...
and so...
well.....
I guess
so is it your friends that won't speak to you?
or their parents who don't want them to?
I can't see your friends blaming you for what your mom did
Chelss......
ok
but before you begin
:-*
:x
ok?
nope
no
Chelss, go ahead
I could never hate you
you must know that
yes I will
I know so
Chelss
Why are you nervous about telling me anything
You know I won't stop being your friend
and because it's the truth
why would I avoid you?
cuz no
My dearest Chelsea...I'll leave it to you
an abortion?
ok
I was guessing
what kind of breakdown?
nervous breakdown?
because of moving, and your bro and sis's staying there
and your mom's troubles and moving here?
I se
see
Chelss
:-*:-P:-*:-P:x:x
I wish I could be there right now to give you a big hug and a kiss to tell you it all be ok
NO!
Chelss...No I don't
believe me, ok?
/:)
:-*
ok....will you be back later?
Chelsea...I would never think you're a freak
I care for you...I do!  And I would never judge you like that
:-*
I'll talk to you soon
:(
hi
Chelss...no
I thought you were mad
or something
I could never think you're a freak
what did you lie about?
not telling me everything about your life?
that's not lying
no
friends my go for a long time without knoing everything about the other
ok?
so you never lied to me
and I'm embarrassed
I never said you did, and I don't think you would
Chelss....
I'm sure you did
try to look at it from the outside
ok?
from my perspective
you're living in PA with friends you've known for years
maybe all your life
and all of the sudden
1) your parents split
2) your mom has serious legal problems
3) your dad meets someone else & matties her
marries*
4) she and he decide to plit you from your brother & sisters
5) they force you to move oput to rual Oklahoma
From just outside Philly to rural OK!
Chelss...what I'm saying is that anybody wouuld have trouble with that
when I came out from Philly to here
to go to college
I cried for 2 weeks straight!
2 weeks!
I did
I swear to you
My mom told me I could come back home if I wanted
but I was here and I knew I'd have to make the best of it
and so I stayed
So Chelss....
:-*:x
ok?
but..........
ok
I'm embarrassed
I lied to you
and now I must come clean
my daughter...
is not 10
she is your age
yes
and a wonderful young lady
I was embarrassed
sort of
I was talking to you
and flirting with you
and....
I didn't want you to think badly of me
I don't know
:(
I'm sorry
I'm the one who lied...not you
no I'm not
Chelss....
we've been talking for less than a week...or just over
you're not supposed to spill your entire autobiography
you tell me of yourself what you want me to know
what you don't tell me is not my business
yes
and it's weird
we are friends
that this computer...it removes the age difference to a certain extent
LMAO
/:)
lol
that was good
100 8-|
:D
it's ok
it was a joke
and I took it as such
it was a joke, wasn't it?
lol
not here
but outside of here it does
:-*
:(
:(
ya
well, outside of here I would have no business placing my lips upon yours
I know
and so it's a good thing that you were in that chat room
I don't really go to chat rooms
but I did that night under that name
and I feel lucky that I did
because I met you
:)
:-*:-P
I hope they're tears of happiness
you are too!
:)
My friend
:-*
and you're MY friend
wow...I just had a Deja vu
like all of this has happened before
you know that feeling you get sometimes?
like everything you're doing has happened before
it lasts a couple of seconds
no we didn't
haven't
but I just had that feeling.  It's called "Deja Vu"
that's french for "Already Seen"
:)
I want to talk about last night
for a minute
all those things I said
no..I did mean
but
we cannot
why the frown?
Chelss
what would happen if we were together?
think about it
wo!
no
that's not what I mean
what I mean is that it may not have been right for me to have laid out such suggestive images
you may be experienced, but still...
I don't ever want to embarrass you
:((

for you
I'll brb
Chelss, I wish you were here...I'll brb

ok....I started to prepare the chicken to go into the oven
and I had this vision of you standing behind me
just talking to me
and we were.....well....
lovers
but we were just talking
well, no not doing anything in the kitchen
just in life
and we were just talking as I cut the chicken
adn I had to come in here and tell you I wished you were here
:D
:-*
I'm making chicken breasts
pounded flat
spiced and baked in a shallow butter sauce
and when I turn them I'll spread a tomato and alfredo sauce on them
and bake them some more
:">...yes I did
lmao
ummmmmmmmm
I don't think you look like a chicken
cluck cluck
so it must be the other thing....whatever that was gonna be
you never said
Chelsea T: or cuz i want us to be...
I'm curious...what is it that you want us to be?
:">
I plead the 5th...lol
the 5th amendment
to the constitution
says you don't have to tell on yourself
lol
:D
but...your statement was about what you wanted us to be
so....
what is that?
yes
what do you want?
no, I don't think you're a freak
so....
yes
I do
but when, I don't know
brb
back
I think I messed up the sauce
ok
but I'll just have to deal
I don't have enough
ok...I have to go turn the chicken
the tomato and alfredo sauce
:-*
:D
lol
ok
I'll be here
:)
how was it?
lol
sorry
oooooooooooooooo
I make chese steaks once in a while
:">
I buy the thin steaks frozen
and rolls
and cook em up
mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
put cheese on em
you deserve a real cheese steak!
:-*
I'm gonna have to go eat in a sec
:-*
:x
:-*:-*
I'll be back later, ok?
:-*:x
:)
busy?
what?
Sweet!
Another SNOW DAY
wooooooooo hoooooooooooo
lol
I use Yahoo at work during the day
so I'll be on
you can say hi if you want
:D...I hope
:-*
yay!
I figure my office will be open...8-|:((
It was fantastic
:)
I wish you could have had some
you know when you bake something you get those little pieces of black burned food?
I scrape those off the pie plate (I bake with glass) and put them on top
MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM
:D
the chicken
:-O
lol
lol
well, it's no poo
but it's actually burnt spices
oh, my dear!
you have no idea what your missing
it's almost as good as..........
as...............
my kisses
lol
or pie
:-*
:">
lol
you guessed right
lmao
yep!
:D
:">
now don't make me start dreaming
:x:x
ummmmmmm
nope
that's strikes 1 and 2
Oh!
kisses is almost right
yep
:)
what position do you play?
Wo!
fast pitch?
dang!
:-*
hey!
I prefer slow anyway :">
;)
lol
ummmmm
:-*:-P
<~~~~~Sighing
and smiling
yes
ok
yes we could
but
it could be risky
we would have to make certain of a few things
if you called..and I call you right back
you would have to delete my number from the caller ID
do you have a cell?
have you used the home phone to call your cell and see if it rings?
that's not fair...they cell company won't charge you for another
ah...ic
so is it 215 or 610?
the area code
no...the cell
not your home
I know you're in 580
well....forget that
lets talk about talking on the phone
how would we do that?
lmao
smart-ass
lol
:D
you are something else!
yes
I have unlimited long distance
so I could call
but you would have to tell me when
I can call any where, and it doesn't cost me a dime
no
I have a different long distance company
I don't use AT&T
lol
it's too expensive
:D
:-*
I use Vonage
lmao
:D
I guess so!
>:)
not nervous about talking to you
i'd love to
just wondering how we could do it
we'll work it out
Chelss
we'll work it out
ya
:">
patience
:x:x:x
:-*
when I am with you
I am
I wish we could talk on the phone
and we will find a way
:-*
hey yes>
?
:">
ok
I see it
lmao
no, I'm not
I'm just a guy
with a weakness for you
not sure how
but...
it feels good
nope
I won't do that either
:">
No, no
Chelss
It's untrue, but I am a writer
and I write of that sort of creature
and I think you know now that I live a pretty...
well, shall we say...
gothic lifestyle
most people who are goth or gothic are only that way because they think it's cool
and dark
and mysterious
so they wear clothes to make them feel like they're part of the night
no
nope, not at all
it is, but not goth
but my vision of darkness comes from inside
and I don't want you to misunderstand
no, it doesn't
I'm a good man
I respect myself
and I respect others
Rubby Jewel is always bitching
lol
her fur is white
so she can't be goth
lmao
dez is always like....
...Hi, Im Dez
oh, Chelss
:-*
me too
ok.....ready?
you thought something wierd of me
my turn
have you seen those Dateline NBC shows where that have that woman pose as a young lady your age
I have wondered
no
not now
I wasn't sure
I had no idea
I didn't know why someone as beautiful as you
would spend time with me here
but as time went by
I said to myself...no
she's real
she's Chelss
do you hate me now?
:(
I'm sorry
yes, I do
:">
and I always will be
ya
you do
that's one reason I'm scared for us to meet
no not that
if we met
we would ...maybe...you know
and then what would we do?
I'd want you to come home with me
but you couldn't
well, as long as you wanted
but prolly
Idk
but I wouldn't want to just leave
not knowing when or if we would ever meet again
that would be torture
:(
oh
us
I want to talk to you
sometime when we're here
and they're gone
you tell me
and if you want me to...I'll call
:x
:D
:">
the dogs had a blast today at the school
they ran and ran
on the ice
lol
and Dez...
you'd think his pee was a sharpie marker that way he was marking everything
hold on...
Ruby Jewel wants me to tell you something
want the doggie ling first
or just the translation
lingo*
she said Wrrrrrrrrr wrrrrr wrrrrrr rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrroof
meaning
She hopes you come visit someday
and she'll try not to be too jealous
and....
woof rrrrrrrrrrr
woof rarrrrrr
Ruby Jewel!
YES!
well, she says I have to tell you
that I.....
really like you
really really like you
:">
:x
:x:x
yes
:-O
:D
darn!
:(
lol
I was hoping you'd say....
you'd do everything to make her jealous
lol
well...
kissing me in front of her
snuggling
and of course.....
ummmmmmmmm
OMG she loves the chicken crud!
but that's not what I was thinking
:">
you and me taking up all of the bed when the lights go out
:">;;)
bige enough for 2
I'll turn the cam on soon and show you
it's a full size
but I'll have to make it
so it's neat
:">
yeah
but I'll pick up the cam so you can see it well
I took a great nap today
about 1:30 to 3:30
I will...we were up late last night
you and me
:-*
and I woke up early
so I needed a nap
and ....
I thought of you
:)
ok
Oh, Chelss
:x:x:x
that is the sweetest thing anybody has said to me in a long time
omg....no!
that is sweet
I wish it weren't your pillow
:x
careful...you'll make me fall for you
saying things like that
:">
:-*:-P
damn, Chelss
we're crazy
:">
because of everything
I feel I shouldn't
but I want to kiss you
on your lips
on your neck
all over
everywhere
:">
I want to hold you so much
and feel your nervous touch
everywhere
Chelss...
:-*:-P
you just haven't had much done for you
well
you couldn't do the wrong thing
nope
lol
that would be cool
you could laugh and giggle the entire time
until you weren't nervous any more
I would love it
lol
ROLFLMAO
that's probably because he was unsure of himself
lol
I can see it: "Dang, Chelss, y u laffin?"
hmmmmm
I'm sorry
now that I know you do it?
I think it would turn me on
:">
to hear you giggle and laugh as I...
kissed you all over your body
:">
:x
lol
it's not getting warm over there, is it?
it's getting hard over here
whoops
getting warm over here
did I say that out loud?
ummmmmm
yes, from you
I'm the one blushing
o yes
I hope so
u make me feel great
>:D<
:-*
:-*
:-*
:x:x:x
that's an "L"
nope
keep guessing
ummmmmmmm
could be, but no
ummmmm
Top of the mornin to ya!
but no
no
no
like is getting warm
lol
:-$
o what?
lol
fair enought
enough
it's just the word
one must be careful with it
never throw it around
ok?
I watch people throw that word around all the time
they don't
they see the word "love" as a means to an end
but love is an end in itself
yes
it's sad in a way
both are true
I really really like you
yes, Chelss
yes
that's perfect
love takes a long time to develop
no
guess what, Chelss
I don't love you either
to start this conversation
I didn't mean to make it
but then I saw it
and I thought...an "L" for Love
and so I brought up the subject
no
you're pretty smart
you know we could not possibly love each other at this point
so ...no I didn't think you loved me
:)
:-*
but
I really really like you
and so....one never know where the world will take them
hmmmmmmmm
ya
">
:x
yes
yes, we really really like eachother
lol
I have to take the dogs out
whenI get back
LMAO!
good idea
and canned air?
when I get back
would you like to see a picture of Gretchen?
:">
ok
brb
:-*
:x
this one is from last summer
She's my "G"
thanks
Here's a cake I made
lol
ya...she was standing by the flag
it was devil's food cake with chocolate icing
:">
ya
um
no
like I said
I like to cook
and especially bake cakes & pies
ya
freshman
this last one is me & here
and the last 3 are pics I shot early in December
this is one I sent to my mom & dad
seperately
my parents divorced when I was 16
it's ok
it was a long time ago
ya
I do
it's not easy
my mom
and that was tough
because my dad and I are like twins
and I think she saw him in me
and was sort of mean to me
in high school
awwww :">
:-*
well...I love her
she's my mother
and I didn't find out until years later that my dad was cheating on her
with lots of women
and so I don't blame her
he and I used to be close
but we barely get along now
but my mother....
y?
because he's an opinionated republican fuck face
pardon my french
:">
it was a little out of character
and unexpected
I think
but my mother
she made me the gothic man I am today
she read horror novels all the time
and was into the occult
she was a reader of tarot cards
When I started writing the tales of "Your Humble Servant"
I started sending them to my dad and sister
via email
and I didn't hear from them
so I called my sis and asked her if she was receiving the stories I was sending her and dad
and she said ya and that they were worried about me
the necklace I wear
the doom cross
remember it
?
if you ever need me to stop typing...type "co" for company
adn I'll stop
/:)
lol
anyway
this necklace is not a toy
and not just a charm
everything of this nature that these people make is blessed by an alchemist
and has power of some sort
an alchemist is a wizard type person
they work with spells & stuff
but....
the first time I put this necklace on something said to me
when you wear this necklace, and you actually think of the necklace
you must kiss it
I don't want to sound stupid
I don't know why
something inside me told me that
yes
I do
on an average day I kiss the 4 ot 5 times
It's jsut something I do
I don't want to sound creepy
no it doesn't
anyway...my grandmother passed away in March
and I went to St. Louis for the funeral
I was a pawl bearer
she was 93
one of the people who carry the coffin
and when we were sitting around all of the family
my sis saw me kiss my doom cross
and got all freaked out
and she called my ex
and tlod her she saw me "kissing my demon jewelry"
L
M
A
O
"Kissing my demon jewelry"
I couldn't believe that
no...she called and we talked
she had read his stories too
and asked me what was going on
I was goth when we met
and forever before that
and then tried to supress it
no, she's not
and then had to let it out again
I have to be me
and she couldn't deal
she told me she didn't know who I was anymore
and I told her I was once again the guy I was when she met me
no...it was part of it I'm sure...but the reasons for our divorce go way beyons
no...it didn't work
so anyway...my sister told me on the phone that she and my dad thought I thought I was a vampire
8-|
I was like...no
and so I had to write this "don't worry about me" email
wanna read it?
lol
I'm gonna close the pics
ok
ready...lol
this is good stuff
lol
:-*:-*
no, she's not
Dad:
I write horror, but my history could make it no other way.  I came of age and entered my adoleasence in an environment of practice in the occult.  There were shelves of horror novels in the living room.  As a young child growing up in Tulsa, when you and my Mother would go out on Saturday night, what did I do?  I would stay up late and get the bejeezus scared out of me watching horror movies.  When I was older, a pre-teen and an early teenager, what were my most prized possessions?  My Monster models.  What books were my most cherished?  The coffee table books you guys bought me on horror movies.
When I went to college and began to establish my own dress code, what was it: Gothic.
Yes, my character comes from me, and when I write his stories I see through his eyes.  When he hunts, I find myself hyperventilating.  You could not know, but when I was writing "She was Like Few Others," and she realized what was happening, and did not try to stop it, I started to cry.  Eventually, I had to stop writing.  I broke down and cried like a baby for probably ten minutes.  I cried for her because he could not.  He can not.  He is a part of me, so I had to.
I will never deny that my vision is darker than the blackest night.  In fact, most of my readers have told me they have never read anything so dark in their lives.  Have you any idea how good that makes me feel?  When people comment to me about "A Winter Story,"  I simply ask: "Could you see your breath?"  To a person they say yes.  As a writer, that is victory.  They have also told me that they did not want the story to end.  I am a painter, and words are my colors.   As a writer, you know of what I speak.  And honestly, you saw yourself there too, didn't you?
However, please rest assured that I am not living in a world of some sort of delusion that I am him.  How can I?  He is a part of me, I am not a part of him.  I am healthy and fairly happy, so please don't worry.  It is like Julie said.  She wonders what the families of other horror writers first thought when the expression of the night began to come out.  
:-*
thank you, Chelss
and ....I did cry
when I wrote this one piece...he took this woman
who loved and loved and loved
but was never loved back
and he took her
and she realized what was happening
and almost asked him to
and I started to cry
that may sound gay
lol
yes, I do
I cried for almost 10 minutes
for her
I hope you can read it someday
that worked well!
:-*
I can send it to your email address if you feel ok giving it to me
I thought so
it's on its way
I don't think so
but I don't care
I've had other who have read my stories ask me the same thing
and I think
these stories must be pretty good
yes...like you did
I consider it flattery
Chelss
I really really like you
soon, but not yet
I want to stay with you a little longer
:-*
:x
:)
so that's why when you told me that you wondered if I was or thought I was
a Vampire
I wasn't surprised or offended
:-*
I was in a debate with a guy about something totally different recently
and I guess he had been to my 360 and read them
because at a certain poing her became frustrated and said: "why don't you just go and hang upside down, or whatever you people do!"
he*
that's what I thought
his aregument was neither sound or valid
and we was losing
lol
lol
ya
ok...so maybe I am all wrong....but you're....fat!
so there!
lol
/:)
sweet
did you say anything to her?
:)
then best just to throw her out and go on
and what was it?
LMAO!
yes it is!
Oh, Chelss

<~~~~Smiling

scented oils
I'll draw a bath for you
with bubbles
and you can relax
and what ever you want to drink, I'll bring it to you
really
and let you soak in the tub
and get all pruny
and then wash your back if you want me to
:">
and then when you get out
I'll give you a long, sensuous back rub
and then pull the covers over you
turn out the lights
and be real quiet
as you sleep
well....
ummmmmm
well, you'll dry off
they'll be bath oils
and you'll smell to pretty
and the back rub will knock you out
and then later I'll crawl into bed and sleep next to you
in the morning you'll wake up with such a smile
maybe
lol
LMAO

and stroke my face and say
"thank you"

I guess I did
and do
I so want to be with you, Chelss
:-*:-*
:x:x:x
yes
would you think badly of me
if I described to you how I see us together sometime
in detail
right now?
I want to kiss you over and over
with our arms around each other
and then my hand would go to your breast
and I begin to massage them
and pull your shirt out of your pants
and unbutton it
and slide it off your shoulders
and slowly take the straps of your bra off of your shoulders
and let them fall
and you yould take your arms out of them
and your bra woudl fall to your waist
and I would kiss and caress your breasts
and you would giggle
and I would stand up and kiss you on the mouth again
and begin to slip my fingers between your pants and your body
rubbing all aroung you gently
and I would pull us together
and you would feel me against you
I would unsnap my own pants and unkip them
unzip*
and take your hand
and you would reach in and take me in your hand
and I would unsnap your pants
and push them off of your hips to the floor
and hold you tightly
to me
and kiss you
and you would push my boxers off of me
and then back up to my shirt
and take that off of me
:">
I would remove your panties
and we would be there
just us
kissing
and holding each other
and we would lay down
and I would be on top
and I would give you what I described the other night
until you were satsified
over and over
I would drink you
and make a mess on me of you
and then kiss my way up your stomach
to your breasts again
and then you your mouth
to*
with my...hardness rubbing against you
and your desire growing
you reach down
and take me in your hand
and point me into you
and I press
and enter you
and begin to move in and out
long, deep
and you moan
and I continue
faster
the slow
long strokes and short
until you reach climax again
and then I would begin to get close
yes, again
adn you could feel me grow inside you
to my largest
and I would whisper to you
Chelss, I'm close
where?
yes
where do you want me when I climax
and I would continue
and then my hips would stop for a second
and then I would climax
and you could feel me
warm
wet
filling you
everytime I go in...more
and more
I groan
and hold you
:">
Oh Chelss
I hope that was ok
and not embarrassing
but I want us to be together
and I see it
I just wish I could bring you home
:(
and we could be together
but not now
perhaps someday
:-*
who knows
if only for a weekend
someday
it would be great
to have an entire weekend together
not for a while
a long while
I know
but I cannot come down this weekend
believe me, I have thought of it
on Sunday
yes
:)
Smile, my dear
My Chelsea
I have news for you
Someday we will be lovers
and who knows
someday
we may fall in love

Sweet!

whoops...sorry
I had a dog named clyde whe I was a boy
yeah a German Sheperd
Awwwwww
that's the way th elegend goes
the legend*
lol
Bonnie & Clyde...do you know who they were?
Bonnie Parker
& Clyde Barrow
They were bank robbers & murderers in the 1920's
worked in MO, OK, TX, KS
this area
yes
lmao
so................you got Clyde, huh?
lol
what colors?
is he a kitten?
sweet
I have to call my mom
for a minute
I'll be right here
Oh!
:-*
awwwwwwww
no return kiss
oh well
she just answered
brb
:)
OMG!
)
I called her to ask her a favor
that I didn't think she would do
You see....
did I tell you that my mother was into the occult ans was a reader of the Tarot when I was young?
Tarot cards are strange in their powers
the user cannot buy a deck for his or her self
their power will disappear
A deck of the Tarot must be given to the user
as a gift
only then will they retain their power
to foretell
the future
also, they must be kept wrapped in black cloth when not used
I called her to ask her if she would buy me a deck of the Tarot
yes
but
she said...why don't I give you my old deck
:-O
It's been wrapped in black and not used for about 30 years
she does not read anymore
because.....
You really have to be careful with Tarot Cards
and Ouija Boards
they are both surrounded bay malevolent (bad) spirits
Tarot cards especially
if the user is not wise, and on their toes
they will begin to lie
Yes
she gave them up
but idk
I have tis need
this*
to explore
to find out
you understand?
to me...
I understand the power of the Tarot
but that power can only be expressed by one who believes
and all my life (after my mom gave up her powers) I have refused to even touch a deck of the Tarot
because...I believed
If Ididn't believe, it wouldn't have mattered to me
I would have treated them like any deck of cards
or just any old object
idk
but there is something inside me
no, Chelss, not because of you
perhaps a little...idk
but there is something inside me telling me, calling me
telling me to learn the Tarot
yes
and to be honest
owning a deck of the Tarot makes me as nervous as thinking of being with you
I don't know what I will do when I unwrap them
I guess I'll touch them..lol
yes
she still lives in PA
holy shit
well, you have to learn how to use them
I can't believe she is gonna send me her cards
jeez
I can't believe she stil has them
but don't you understand
when she walked away from those cards
and everything else
those cards retained a large portion of her power
and her believe
belief
that's good
because I am her son
and my power and my belief will be added to hers
in that deck
OMG
I'm nervous
just the whole thing
my heart is beating fast
almost like you and I were about to kiss
no
I must
it's hard to explaain
but I must
it's like the gothicness in me that my ex couldn't accept
and everything in me that I am allowing to come out and find expression
I hope you don't think badly of me
Chelsea...
I'm a good person
but the dark side of this universe exists within me
and it's not bad
and it's not evil
it's not anything like that
it is the night...and it just "is"
I don't mean to be
but I want you to know all sides of me
just as you want me to know all sides of you
I think you do
you have
and why
and Chelsea
I shall always be
even when you don't need one
I'll be there...somewhere....you'll be able to find me
easily
lol
ssorry...but that seemed strange
what I wrote seemed almost a little poetic
and your response was   "ok"
No
You always know what to say
can you do me a small favor?
please don't think I'm going away
I'm not
and I know when I write like that it can sound that way
I won't
but I'm feeling...........expressive
tonight
I feel alive!
MY MOTHER IS GOING TO SEND ME HER DECK OF THE TAROT!!!!!!
LOL!
ya, you would
LOL
Chelsea
!
I'm going to be up and down for a few
making dinner
bit it will be something quick to night
and after that I will write

*hurl*
I just sent a message
to your myspace
ok
it's for in a little while
uh oh what?
ok
yes
yes, Love...Aquarius
replied
really!
lemme check sumfin
ok...Aries & Aquarius and.......
Love
Fire and air usually compliment each other but not in this case of two people so self willed that the arguments start, most likely, on the day they meet.   Aquarius is intrigued by weird, unusual, and sometimes very eccentric type of individuals that attract his/her attention.
Aries must learn to put up with all of these and it will help if she/he is also a friend as well as a lover, for Aries will prefer the companionship of the more successful, swinging, and sophisticated type of people which only serve to drive Aquarius to distraction. 
it will not be easy
lol
ummmmmmm
our
love
lol
they say we are not very compatible
but what do they know, anyway!
yes...or very soon 
no
nope
no, Chelss
not soon, but much sooner than that

did you read the one I sent you the other night?
yes, but until I discoevered him...I really cvouldn't

and after that....his stories just started flowing from me
and that's how it started
lol
I thought so
want me to past it here?

It's called A Winter Story
I remember the night I almost was caught, almost discovered.  For you humans it would have been freezing cold, but I don't feel that.  Snow covered the ground, and I was dressed warmly just for show.  Just so I wouldn't stick out like a warm thumb.  As was my habit, I was walking the streets of a nearly deserted suburb, looking for a meal.  I don't need anything too warm, 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit will do nicely.  It must have been a little after midnight, hell who cares.  Every day for you is like a second for me.  There were sparse people scurrying every so often, but I let them pass, let them know joy another day.
I had almost decided on a nice meal that would satisfy my hunger when I heard it.  Not a single one of you would have ever heard it.  The sound was so faint, and yet so close by.  Just behind me and up to the left.  I stopped, stood silently, and slowly turned.  I was as a tree, and I blended with the night.  I saw him, I knew he was the one, and without hesitation I sprang.  Silently and deadly I lunged over 150 feet in a little less 2 seconds.  For a fat bastard he was quick, but not quick enough.  Usually prey like this never know their life is over until it is.
This fast joker was actually aware of me just long enough to acquire a look of absolute terror on his face before I grabbed him.  I was upon him like a panther on a sick antelope, pulling him down.  His sack of parcels dropped from his arms and we tumbled from the roof of a house.  I stopped us from crashing to the ground and we landed softly and silently in the snow.  The parcels made noise, but seemed to stir no one.
Damn, my blood was flowing so hot I could barely keep from screaming.  With a heavy panting and the steam of my breath creating fleeting clouds of ambiance, I looked down at the unfortunate gentleman who would serve as my nourishment for the night.  He was looking back at me.  He was an old coot of a man, but still full of fight.  Not enough fight to win, though.  Not enough fight to save his life.
He struggled, and like a cat with a newly captured mouse, I toyed with him for a minute, but never lossened my grip on his neck.  I never allow my dinner to scream.  Then, I flung away his grandpa's beard and sunk my teeth into his neck.
Oh!  Oh!  I had never tasted anything like this.  This meal was so rich, so warm, so indescribable.  It was as if he were centuries old.  He was a fine wine, aged to perfection, just for me.  I began to lose myself; his blood began to send me into an almost sexual frenzy.  Who was he?  What was he?  I swear to eternity I had never felt anything like this.  I had an erection, and the more I drank, the wilder I became, until I found myself tearing at his flesh, and eating my way through is neck.
This was when the danger began to mount.  I began to lose track of my surroundings.  My keen hearing and smell grew dull as I savored the blood of something that must have been just short of immortal.  Then from nowhere I found myself bathed in light and heard a door open.  I pulled myself from my blood-splattered feast and looked to the source.  It was a human female child of about 5 years.  I hissed at it in a spray of blood and meat with a fury I had seldom mustered before.
Though I wanted to kill it on the spot, I was suddenly overcome with an overwhelming sense of self-preservation and I dropped my meal in a heap on the snow, stained with blood and sinew.  As quickly I had set myself upon my prey minutes before, I fled into the night.  When I was at a safe distance I could only hear the horrified screams of the human child: "Santa!"
:D
yes, it's true
I killed Sants
Santa
LMAO!
L
O
L
So....you'll need to tell all the little kisds in Walters
Santa isn't gonna be coming around anymore
Herr Hollrah drank his blood
and left him in a heap on the snow
Well, what did you think about that final twist?
there ya go!
well, ya
sick too
but still...a little funny
you should read # 4
he gets his fangs into Jesus
lol...kidding
LMAO....that was good...."omG"
but no, I was actually thinking of writing one with Jesus in it
no joke
he doesn't bite Jesus
but happens upon him
and leaves immediately
but I don't know if I will
I'm not really into that
well....I'm not a christian
and so I don't know if I should mess around with Jesus
he's pretty sacred to alot of people
you know?
really?
ya
are you in a good humor right now?
ok
so...when they passed the plate around, was she puttin in, or takin out?
joke

Please 
I apologize

Chelss...I have no excuse for saying that
I can only offer you my sincerest apology
:((
I can't blame you if you hate me
Chelsea
I just hope you can forgive me someday
I would never want to make you cry
nothing
no
no
Oh, Chelsea
I am so sorry
please
I don't know what to say
I wish I was perfect
because I wasn't sure if you could look at it and not feel bad
I know that
no, Chelsea
I know
I hope you can forgive me
I am really sorry
I would never want to make you cry
but I did
and I feel terrible
I will be

Chelss

:(
Chelss......

I hope you do
I'll understand if you don't
at least for a while

a little after 6
it means...........
I Love You
and in a real sense...I do
as a good friend
and it's true
and I remember
don't worry
but.........I should go for now
I'm on a phone call
bye for now
Chelsea
and yes...
last night I thought I was having a heart attack
when I did that
and ............
who knows what the future will hold
Not a real heart attack, but I felt lik a real ass for what I said
Chelsea....:x:-*
Forgive me
Please
I'm home if you wanna talk to me
I don't know what to say to you, so maybe I shouldn't say anything
If I had any idea I was about to be so stupid and unfeeling
I would have stopped myself
but I was to dumb to see the effect of what I was about to say
ya
is there anything you want me to say or do?
yes
how many times?
lol
almost
but still maybe a few short of what I owe you
I don't blame you
How about this?
Ruby Jewel & Dez.......
said Grrrrrrrrrr
Grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr  rowwwwwwwww rowwwwwwwwww
and then bit me on the nuts last night
that hurt
then Ruby Jewel said
wooooooof wooooooof Grrrrrr Grwwaaaallllll Woof
which means: "You really are a complete fuck-up sometimes"
and I said: I know
and Dez
didn't say anything
but he took a dump on the carpet

a little
because I worked on the training document here last night

so that I could make changes to the copy on my computer easily when I got to work today
and then send it out
well....the copy I brought home and worked on?
I forgot it and left it here
<~~~~~IDIOT!
and so I had to try to make all the changes from memory
yes
but it took alot longer
and I was still working on it at 9:30
but...everything went off great
except.............
lol
the training room we had....
the company ripped out all of the computers
and had the presenter's computer (the only one left) set so that I couldn't log into it
8-|..OMG
we had to use a conference room
and I used the computer in there, and the people in the department sort of gathered around
but the people in Omaha were all at their desks
so they were able to work along
it was good
:)

Hahn Merlot
my favorite wine
:)
someday I'll pour you a small glass
yeah
I like red wine
ok...lol
well, maybe I can convince you to take a couple of sips of some of my favorites
Merlot is a little sweet
but still it has a full body to it
its hard to describe
no, it doesn't
there are wines that taste like grape juice
but you won't find them here
yeah
lol
:x
:x
:x
Fruit punch
milk
water
coffee
lol
Some Bailey's Irish Cream
and that's it
what would you like?
bailiey's?
it's touch to describe
it's sort of chocolaty, and coffeeish
let me see
caramel
that's the flavor
and it is NOT cheap
lol
this little bottle was $14.00
yeah...you use very little when you drink it
I mix a little with whipping cream and ice
and sip it
it's a liqueur
it really is
so it is technically an alcholic beverage
but is doesn't have alot
brb
Oh!
ok
:x:x.....
:x
:-*
put the baileys back
in the kitchen
lol
you nut!
:x

woman and a werewolf

:x
yes
:D
what do you think you didn't understand?
I'll bet you did
hmmm
that's right
she thought he was going to have sex with her
and in a way he did
he brought her to orgasm
both through playing with her
and through the ecstacy of his bite
and in the end he released her
from her misery
yes
she had loved and loved and loved all her life
and alwyas had it thrown back in her face
Chelss.........Love..........Thank you for saying that
no...the love she gave
but she was willing to keep going
correct
but he knew
that it would never be any different
ever
and that she would continue to have her heart broken over and over and over again
and in the end...she knew it to
too*
that's why when he said
The jury finds you guilty of love for a species that knows only hatred
the judge sentences you to death
the sentence to be carried out immediately
well, he starts the story by talking about bein Judge, jury, and executioner over humans
yes
so...when he said that....what did she say back?
"Please"
she said "Please"
she asked him to take her
and when he bit into her
right down next to her vagina
she had her last orgasm
and accepted it
have I told you about writing that story?
when I got to that part
I started to cry
and I had to stop
yes
it was amazing
everything was so clear
it always is
when I write of him
I can see it all as if I'm there
and at that point, I need only put it to paper
Yes, Love...I will always write from now on
:">
thanks you
:-*

well, when I wake up, I roll over on my back
and that's sort of the signal to the puppies that I'm awake
and Dez always walks up right on my chest and starts saying good morning
Dez is a little stingy with the kisses
but he snorts
and rubs his head in my chest
and then makes like he's gonna give me a kiss
but then snorts & rubs

I do know this, though
the father only needs to know 3 sentences when his woman's pregnant
1) Yes Dear
2) let me get that for you, dear
3), you're right...It's all my fault, dear
it gets that way near the end
when she's real big
and her feet swell
and she's miserable
and she blames the dad
I know...:(
it is!
lol
ok...10 mins
I'll have to go for a couple of minutes

the eggs will be ready
and I'll have to chop them up
and finish the Tuna Salad

Hey!
I had a hell of a time
8-|
ok........
I make the tuna salad
and of course...ladt night wal-mart has no bread, because all the toothless country in-bred freak show beople bought is all up
last*
so I have to buy some brand I don't even want
Healthy Poop Grains 
or something like that
and, I don't know
I just don't like chunks of shit in my bread
Like "whole grains"
so I thought I bought a loaf that didn't have any
no...lol
but it did
so I go to the hell-mart to buy eggs
well...first...the tuna
I amke the tuna...get out the bread...and what do I see?
make*
chunks of shit
#-o8-|
no, in the bread
like whole grain chunks
hippy bread
lol
lmao
so...I fugure I'm screwed, but I have to go get eggs anyway
just reg wheat bread
u?
LMAO!!!!!!!!!!
well.....
peace out
LOL
I guess I could learn
lol
anyhoooooo
lol
so I go t hell mart to get the eggs
and they don't have a single friggin egg in the entire place
not kidding
so....I head to albertson's
I hate Albertsons
but............they have eggs
so I get a dozen eggs, and almost to the register, and it hits me
I lieft my cash at home
#-o
o yes
so, luckily the Albertson's is less than 1/2 mile from my apartment
so I go home, get the cash and go back
I also pick up a loaf of non-hippy bread
lol
and it comes to $4 and change
well...1st
there are 2 cashiers and 4 self-check outs
and about 20 people waiting to check out
so I go to the kid at the command center
and say" Why don't you get another cashier ot 2 up there?
or*
and he looks at me with the stupidest look I've seen all day
and does nothing
so I stand in line for what seems like forever to buy 2 items
lol
I think
so I've also decided that I'm gonna get some plate hangers and do some decorating around gere
and albertsons has.....0
so I have to go to Hobby Lobby
and that went rather smoothly
and then I made it home
#:-S
yes...like today

every other
I want to cook dinner for her
nope...her mom is at work, and she hangs out at home
because really...there's not much for her to do here
I set up her studio
and she can paint
but if she's not in the mood to paint, she just watches TV
:(
and we talk some
we talk and laugh quite a bit
:)
but today we're going to the mall
she has a $50.00 gift card from dillards from her grandpa
christmas
so we'll do that and then come here
but her mom never really cooks
that's how I learned to cook
lol
ok, this may sound gross
and/or gay
lol
but.....
I've been thinking I could really use an apron
because I cook alot
and stuff
ya
I know
so anyway, on friday I'm walking to the braums at the other side of the giant parking lot near my office for lunch
and I have to walk behind this restaurant/bar/grill
and what is laying out there?
lol...no
no...but I'll tell you a story about that
nope
an apron!
so I go to the braums
get lunch
and on the way back...I pick up the apron
and take it to me car
it was sort of nasty
ya
greasy
but I washed it twice
as soon as I got home
in HOT water
and it's all good now
it's clean...doesn't stink
well, yeah, I can afford to buy one
it's brown
lol
really...I know
but it will do for now
I wish!
whoops
I mean NO!
lmao
ya...:-&
it is, but......
I was thinking I really needed an apron, and the universe said...here...use this one until you find one you really like
WITHOUT gay ass flowers
or the fates
whichever
kind of
it does!
it gave me a free apron
LMAO
and ya...it's brown
and gross, but it was free
LMAO
ROFLMAO
what?
u will!
by then it'll be gone
no...I mean u will make it to my place
or....
I'm gonna save it
and sneak up on u
and rub it all over you !
and then run
cuz I know you'll beat my ass when you catch me
awwwww :(
lol
I keep it hung up
:-*
yes?
Chelss?
no
I found them all out behind restaurants
LMAO
and in dumpsters
and took some off of old winos
and hobos
and crack junkies

and when I see one that wears a size 8 1/2

I've actually been thinking of buying a sewing machine
Peach...with kitties?

etc*
then I have to sew them
something I want to tell you??????
ummmmmmmm

ummmmmmmmmmmmm
I want to tell you...............
I adore you
and..........
I'm not bi
or gay
but.
I'm also not super macho
I'm just me
lol
:">:D
:-*
jeez...there's so much about me I want to tell you
about my life
just stuff I've been through
no
I was small...very small
when I was young
and some bullies thought they would start picking on me
but somehow I knew that if I let that happen then, it would never stop
and so I attached the Mother fu**er
and beat the shit out of him
8
and nobody ever picked on me again
:)
lol
lol
I think he was so surprised
no
and his friends thought it ws funny
they didn't try to help him
we were on the ground fighting
and I got on top of him
and just started punching him in the face
lol
and he didn't know what yo do
to*
LOL
and I just kept wailing on him
well, finally his friends pulled me off
lol
and they took off
and I walked the rest of the way home
and I was crying
because I was scared about what had just happened
I was never a "fighter" as it were
but the next day...
at school
it was all ove the place
everybody knew what happened
lol
and nobody ever tried to pick on me again
and then in high school I was on the wrestling team
and there was this senior Mark Dambly...I was a sophomore
and ther was this shy kid on the team whose name I can't remember
He wasn't too much bigger than me
and Damble was big...on the football team and stuff
Dambly
and he used to pick on this kid
I mean hit him and push him down
really hard...
hurt him a couple of times
and nobody said anything
then one day we were in the locker room
and he was messing with this kid
and I started screaming at Dambly
You fucking coward!
stop messing with him
I went off!
and Dambly came at me
lol
and really...he was more than twice my size
we would have
but it's like everybody was just waiting for somebody to say something
and before he could get to me, 2 guys bigger than him jumped him
and said don't you dare touch him
he's right!
leave that kid alone
and they went off
on him
and then everybody did
lol
well...no
but it's like i'm not afraid to stand up
:">

and guess what...it's black
Hye!
HEY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Yes!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Yippee
I swear
it looked a little brownish when I picjed it up
picked*
partly because I guess I expected it to be brown
but I just put it on and looked in the mirror in the bathroom...and it's black
LOL............./:)
ok...yes
I'm color blind
red-green color blind
no, U swear
well, that means I have trouble with some reda and greens
well........
that's a technicality
lol
I guess being color blind isn't like being pregnant
:-*
well, that say you can't be "just a little bit pregnant"
you either are, or you're not
LMAO
:((
It's black, I swear
ok
yup
no
I'm gonna cook in a minute
LMAO
ummmmmmmm
sorta
no
I asked her if I could cook her anything and she said not today
and we hadn't planned on her being here late
so she went home
but I took her to the mall
and we decided that since dillards really isn't her kind of store
that she would give her gift card to me
and she could shop $50.0 wotrth anywhere she wanted
we ended up going to borders
and she bought a book
brb
yeah, just one...$9.00
so I told her she still has $41.00 left
ok...ready for the apron?
............................
ok
and you know what those dots also mean.....

ewwwwwwwwwwwwww
idk...just think I am sometimes
sort of
and.......
I don't want you starting to think..."You know...he's sort of funny lookin"
:">
lol
nothin
I thought I looked....
funny lookin
idk
well, not today as a whole
I looked hot!
lol
Chelss...I knaoe
know*
but still, I'm self conscious
I guess I've always thought I was somewhat funny lookin
but still...handsome in a way
ahhhh who knows
kk
me too
:-*:-*:-*
ok
well, I guess we all have our insecurities
idk
thanks, Chelss
that means alot to me
I'll turn it on later
:">

:">
looking at the screen
looking at the keybord
and you can tell
you can tell my heart beats fast for you too
I smile
and laugh
only the funny ones
lol
which is all of them
:-*
:x
:">
not sure
I'm really not
down deep, I'm comfortable with my looks
nah
<~~~funny lookin
I try not to judge myself based upon commercial looks
u know what I mean?
women get it the worst
all this "perfect body" stuff
and "super models"
WTF is a super model anyway?
do they wear capes
and save people?
but making the crooks think they're so hot
show some leg...stop a crime
lol
that'd be a cool short film
about a real super model
stopping crime
by being hot
lol
yeah
as she struts down the streen
street
with bad guys following her
drooling
she walks em right to the police station
hell no
just do her "runway show" walk
and stop every once in a while and spin
for the cameras
lmao
NO!
the censors would shoot down all my stuff
lol
censors...the people who decide what you can and cannot say or do on TV
but...I could do stuff for HBO
or Showtime
lol
she has the spiked choker of death
and the fishnets of justice
lol
ummmmmmmmmmmm
you'll never know
untill you put on a choker and fishnets
then you'll know what I'm thinkin about
lol
:-O
:(
you would be gorgeous!
to the italics?
ctrl i
for italics
ctrl b for bold
hold down the control buttin and hit the letter "i"
and then type
no
I do it as I'm typing
well...I stop typing for a sec
no
once you hit them you will see the cursor that stays with what you're typing go from straight up to slanted
and to stop it...you do the same thing again
sweet
do the same thing with the "b"
instead of "i"
and now the "u"
yup...all three
underline
check this out
dang...brb
:x

I bought some Soccer Jerseys a month or so ago to sell on ebay
I've sold all but 3
heck yes!
nope
I saw then at a goodwill store 
them*
$2.99 each
Adidas official OU Soccer team Jerseys
I bought 12
want me to save one for you?
:">
I have white with a red stripe down the center
and red with white highlights on the shoulder
the red one is....sheer
it would make a great bed shirt for you
it's long too
:">
the tag says.......M
DONE!

if that's ok
lol
:D
:-*
:">
and it'll be hand delivered!
I don't know when....
but I'll keep it as long as I have to
well, it depends on what it is
like OU stuff
you can get it cheap, and people who went to OU who live in ...say...New York can't find OU stuff out there
college team stuff always sells well
:x
commemorative plates don't sell well

well...
ya
it doesn't sound bad
you have no idea the crap people will buy on ebay

idk
but I know he's old
WAY WAY WAY WAY WAY older than me
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
;;)
>:D<:-*:-P
I know
hmmmmm
no
I'm with you
I'm not shooting any pics
so........
I used to be in the toy business
once upona  time...I used to be in the toy business
in a way
I worked for an importer
we imported toys * novelty items from china & taiwan
and we did alot of trade shows around the country
tell...you rent booth space at a convention center
and retailers (store owners) come and look at your stuff
and place order
yes
but it's only for people in the business or "trade"
wholesales are the exhibitors 
and stores are the buyers
I used to travel all ove the country all the time
every year I'd spend 2 weeks in LA
3 weeks in New York
3 weeks in Chicago
a week in Miami
San Francisco, Atlanta and so on
and ...3 weeks in Las Vegas
well...one time we were in vegas
and me and another guy were on the bus going downtown
so he could gamble
I wasn't really into gambling
well, we are at the back of the bus
and there is this little oriental woman ther
as this black guy who bacame the problem
lol
we're sitting there and I'm sittin in a see that look across the bus...no forward
he is sitting right actoss from me
the woman is sitting next to him, nut in a seat tha looks forward
and the guy I'm with is sitting in the seats across the very back of the bus that look forward
I, of corse am gressed to go out for the night
that means black
lol
well, this guy is a little drunk
no, but I might as well have been 
and he is bitching about the people at Harrah's
casino
stealing all his money
and he begins to harass this woman
she's just sitting there
and I can tell she's scared
so I tap her on the shoulder and ask her to go sit next to my friend
lol
and she does
and this guy starts getting real loud
and people on the bus are starting to wonder what's going on
so the bus driver stops the bus and comes back and tells the guy to be quiet of get off the bus
well, the guy goes off
now the bus driver is a black guy too
but whereas the guy across from me is thin, the bus driver is a big guy
well, there's really nothing the bus driver can do
so he goes back and starts driving again
well, the guy is pretty proud of himself
I guess not...he can't touch the guy I guess
so the guy makes his last mistake
he looks at me and sauy something about what a bad ass he is, and puts out his hand like he's gonna "gine me 5"
give*
well....
I pretty much pour all of the psychological energy I have in me out at him and withouth flinching I say
I want you to sit down, sit back, and not say another word until you get off this bus"
and I look at him like I'm a fuckin vampire I guess
and he gets this look on his face like he's all confused
and he sits down, sits back, and doesn't say a word
I keep looking right into his eyes witout blinking
and then it hits him what's going on, and he sits forward and opens his mouth like he's going to say something
and I say in a calm but very forceful voice...
I said sit down, sit back, and don't say another word until you get off this bus!
and he sits back
and starts to look scared
and he pulls the cord to signal the busdriver to stop the bus
and gets off
lol
and when he he left I just friggin let out this breath
like HOLY SHIT!
well...I put the psycho-fuck on him
pardon the language
but that's what it was
I had to
and Don, the guy I was with
his mouth was hanging open
and he said what the hell did you just do?
Chelss...look
all I did was let the guy know..by the vibes I was putting out
that I wasn't kidding
that he was out of control
and scaring people
and I wasn't gonna have it
it wasn't psychic powers
not really
him yeah
he wasn't to bright
no...him, I just stood up to him
and if those 2 guys hadn't stepped in
he'd a beat the stit outta me
he was gonna
he was coming for me
but...that sort of thin only works if you're in the right
u know?
because if somebody is in the wrong
and you stand up to them and 
then you will get by with it most of the time
but if you're in the wrong
it'll be trouble
u see what I mean?
now, this guy on the bus
I'm not a street fightin guy
I'm a peaceful man
but I won't sit by and lett people scare others if I can stop it
and the only weapon I had at my disposal was my mind
and the energy I can pour from it
but I was determined to have him settle down
no
and stop scaring people
but...when he got off that bus
people were looking at me like.....
what is that guy
lol
and that's only because they wouldn't stand up themselves
Chelss..........
:-*:x
when I was growing up
I was smaller than th eother boys
and so I couldn't establish my place in the pecking order byr being bigger and stronger
so...
ya
who's #1
2
3
4
and so on
I have to develop a mind that allowed me to compete with them
I had to be smarter than them
because I couldn't be bigger or stronger
see?
and when you have to devote yourself to be ing smarter than other people
in order to compete
you eventually are able to do things once in a while like I did to that guy on the bus
I don't want you to think I'm a witch
or a freak
:(
or I have scary psychic powers
I don't
but...like we said earlier
I'm not afraid to stand up to people
well, I don't think I do
but
know this
if I do...
I would never ever ever use it on you
:(
:((
now you're scared of me
I guess that was the wrong story to tell
th eonly power I have is an active and curious mind
I understand that we never stop learning
and so I remain curious about the world around me
I do have on mysterious power
one*
my kiss
:D
:-*
:">

I'm not gonna be around as much
I don'r wanna go into the whole thing
I'll still be here off and on
why I won't be here as often

I don't want you to see me as letting you down
and I care about you
nothing's wrong

I have to go
bbs
phone
bbs
back
sorry
Chelss
I did
Recently
accidentally
we met like a month and a half ago
but met again some days ago
and...
idk
:(
I think of you
and I know that you and I cannot be together or anything for a long time
what?
no
whe we met a month or so ago I thought nothing of it
I though we would never meet again
never expected to
but you noticed a difference in me this weekend?
yes
I was writin
yes
on 2 nights I wrote almost 7 pages
I have never lied to you
no...the story I'm writing
but this weekend
we met and talked
day date
I spent my nights here alone
she is 33
My God Chelssea
I don't want you to hate me
but you're gonna
why?
please
yes
what was I to say?
I can't talk right now because I have to talk to Chelsea?
I'm in hell here, Chelss
I'm so sorry
this will
our friendship will go right for you
but
that's untrue
we cannot think of being together
we must be friends
I'm sorry
don't
feel stupid
NO!
NO!
don't accuse me
of that
I thought of you
all day every day for weeks
but always in the back of my mind I knew
we could never be together
but at the same time
I so wanted to hold you
and tp laugh with you
no
Chelss
I want us to be friends
we can try
I woudl like to
but I cannot spend as much time with you as I have
Chelss
let me ask you a question
ok?
what would you rather me have done
talk to you here, now
or just never say another word
I came here to talk to you because I care
and I know you trusted me
if I didn't
I would have just disappeared
Chelss
I deserve what your saying
I never meant for things to work out this way
Chelss
I'm not gonna delete you
and I'm not gonna let you down
I will always be here
if you need someone to talk to
I'll send you an IM later
tomorrow
Chelss, I couldn't sleep either
I don't know how many times I woke up 
and I was kicking myself for upsetting you like that
I want to talk to you later
Chelsea!!!! :((
Chelss?
Are you there?
:-S
I'm gonna go do the dishes & start dinner
I'll be back soon
hi
:-S
just tell me if you don't want me to talk to you
I violated the rule we made
that we don't tell each other
I'm sorry
:(
I hope so, but I'll understand
I messed up twice with you
and I just seem to make you mad
alot of the time
I know
no!
it's my fault
that I mess up
and do and say the wrong things
Chelss
no
you are yourself
all the time
that's what I like
you have a wonderful sense of humor
you're beautiful
it's still ok!
Chelss, there's nothing in the world wrong with you
any guy would be lucky to have you like him
you're not stupid at all
I should have kept my mouth shut
like we agreed
I read your offlines this morning
I never said I was in love
Chelss, let me say this, ok?
let's say, for example that I came down there last weekend
ok?
and we met at the mall
let's just say
and started kissing in the only place we could go
and all of the sudden there's a knock on the window
what happens?
security guard or something?
you go home
I go to jail
and here I am
yes
I really really like you
but that possibility is always in the back of my mind
Chelss
no
I swear it
I swear
I did not
our relationship is only between you and me
I swear it
ok?
Early on in our relationship we knew it would be a long time before we could see each other
right
we both said so
but the more we talked all the time
the more I wanted to see you
now
idk either
how I'm acting
but I'm a little freaked out
over my feelings for you
then I need to keep my poop together
and not want to meet you so badly
ok?
I know
I am
but do you think for one minute that if we met we wouldn't kiss?
many times?
Chelss
I came close to suggesting I come down there to the mall
darn close
but stopped myself
and said I couldn't
halfway to convince myself
I know you do
I know you knew I wanted to come down
that's part of the reason I said I couldn't
so we both knew
I wanted to
ya
so did I
but I knew I couldn't
no now
not*
I'm sorry I'm an asshole
3/4 of the time
I am
I can be sweet
but pretty stupid too
ya
we are
I've always said
if people came out of the caves 50,000 years ago
women have evolved 50,000 years from that point
men have evolved about 50 feet
Chelsea Taylor ten Kate
I'm sorry
you don't have a choice
I'm sorry?
or no coice?
choice
for us to be different
lol
but, I'm sorry I'm an idiot
I really like you
well...
soon you won't be so young
but I'll still be an idiot
yes
don't worry
actually, I think I can't go to jail for kissing you when you're 15
lol
I'll check
lmao
idk
because you're birthday is April 01
and you'll be 15
I think
ummmmmmmmmmmm :">
idk
yes, Chelsea
but right now I have to do the dishes and make dinner
yes, I'm serious
hey...I got home late
traffic
and I have to eat
but before I go
I want to ask you to forgive me
I'm sorry
well...you thinking about it?
well...you had every right
you don't need forgiveness
you did nothing wrong
I'll talk to you later
and
:-*:-*
and
:x:x:x
I'll talk to you later :D
bye
I'm actually gonna write and try to finish this story
but I thought I'd say hi
I know I can't finish it tonight
there's probably about 5 pages of story left
when it's complete?
probably about 15 pages
it's 10 now
and he hasen't even started killing anybody yet
lol
and in this story
there are........
25
people who are gonna die
but he won't kill them all
the dogs and wolves who are with him will kill most of them
thanks
well, dogs and wolves are the reason we never find evidence of him
they clean up afterwards
but these 25 people have been torturing and killing dogs
and the dogs and wolves have asked for his help
yes
and they will get what they have coming
no!
lol
Big dogs
German Shepherds
really!
they would get ahold of some guy's nut sack!
and hang on for dear life
grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
RJ just looked at me and said woof, grrrrr grrrrr
that means: you can be so stupid sometimes
she was talking to me
lol
no..she won't
ok...1 sec

lol
here's the 2 sentences I just wote, ok?
I was like a hole in the night; I wrapped myself in blackness so deep and so dark that I repelled any light what would seek me out.  I drew this darkness from both the center of my soul, and from the night all about me.
lol
Thak you
you're supposed to

We must wait

It's a difficult situation for us
I know
The future is not written
we will when the time is right for us to meet
and I hope that is sooner rather than later
but we will know when it's right

I figured
no shit!
lol
ROFWY?
lol
ok
well..let's talk later
I'm gonna try to get back to it
He's already done 2 of three guys
want to read a little?
19
ok...this is the first guy
I did not allow the small band coming towards me to enter more than ten meters into the darkness beyond the security of the light thrown from their fire before I struck.  In anticipation of them I had grown the nails on the fingers on my right hand into four razor sharp blades. 
When they were almost upon me and still in a tight group, I stepped in silence from behind a tree to their left, and with a movement which incorporated speed, strength, and precision only my species can achieve, I passed these blades through neck of the one closed to me.  I tore his entire throat from him.
Instinctively, he dropped his weapon and reached for the point of injury.  He did not have to see what had happened, he could feel it.  It was not pain, but rather a strange mixture of his warm blood shooting from him and the cool night air on the musculature of his neck.  To his momentary dismay he reached for his neck tried to grasp it, but it was not there
His mind entered the stretch run of its existence and made him instinctively grasp for it further.  Within half a second he knew the truth.  His hands felt the strands of bleeding tissue and the partially exposed bone of his upper vertebrae.  That was his moment of final realization.  He still had enough his wits about him to understand what had happened so quickly
The last thing he ever knew what that his head was attached to his body by no more than 20 percent of what was his neck, and he barely even felt it happen.  His eyes rolled back, his head fell backwards and he collapsed in a silent spray of blood. 
:)
lol
brings a smile to your face, doesn't it?
ya
lol
ya think?
LOL
well, he has no emotional tie to it
he's not human
and anyway
the thinks these people were doing to helpless, innocent dogs
torturing them
and killing them in the most horrible ways
for fun

when he needs to
well...

:-*
That's a pleasant surprise!
Stopped by to say hi...I guess you'll be starting softball practice soon
well, dear Chelss...I'll TTYS
:-*
hi
I received your kiss this morning
cooking
hanging out
Their great
happy
hanging out
and how are you?
OMG
what does your mom say?
she think he'll be ok?
Oh, Chelss, I'm sorry
:(
She probably had been
thinking about him?
idk
you'll just have to tell him you love him extra next time you talk to him
you would
we all do
:-*
it's ok
stop crying
when my brother died
I didn't think I would
yes
I was 33 her was 36
he*
we were really close
he had a stroke
and died 10 days later
on Jan. 30
no
he was a Christian
wife
4 kids
ya
he didn't drink
didn'r smoke
nothing
but something happened
and he had a stroke
Jan 30 is my Mom's b-day
talk about shitty
ya
ya
but I cried alot
when he was in the hospital
I was really angry with the dosctors
I told them he was too healthy
and they didn't do enough for him when he first came in
and that as far as I was concerned
they murdered him
I was really angry
that's what I told them
Debbie is an RN with lots of experience
and she saw all the thinjgs they weren't doing for him
to save him
and we got into his room in the ICU 2 days before they pronounced him dead
and we did things like shine a light in his eyes
and reaction
the were "fixed and dialated"
they*
we was already dead
and when we went into the family meeting with the doctors
I went off
where what?
no..."went off"...gor really angry at them
after that
I wasn't allowed in the family meetings anymore
ya
no
I have a younger sister
8-|
ya
lol
ummmmmmm
ya...she's be the one
lol
going 2?
coming from!
one
:">
in a way
nvm
yes, you did
lol
but it was very subtle
:)
Softball start soon?
ya
I'll be rooting for you
strike em all out!
or ground out back to you
or pop em up to you
you'll be a 1 woman team
varsity!
starting!
U R
yes
ok
that's settled!
ooooooooo
sorry
i can't warm u up
dang
even in summer?
brown!
some
mostly fill in
but getting close to finishing
no, but soon
6 are dead
the wolves will get most of the rest
really?
what've u been thinking?
thank you
does it give you erotic dreams?
sexual dreams
no
but there is an underlying sexuality to him
ya
u r
very well
i might add
no
no
lol
:">
:-*
thank you, Chelss
no
i never said he
's a vampire
he just is
what he is
nope
he is beyond human
beyond anything we can understand
he's no hero
he is evolved from human
and therefore, his higher on the food chain
higher on the evolutionary ladder
which makes him closer to god
than humans
yes...ironic isn't it
but after all...we created god in our image
yes
we decided what we wanted god to be
and we made him that way
heck...the fact that people see god as a "he" tells you we made him up the way we want him
the true god of the universe is neither he noe she
nor*
God can have no gender
I've been thinking about the nature of god for over 25 years
we have to
each person has to decide these things for themselves
what is god?
why are we in the universe
what is my purpose, if any?
all those questions
lol
that's one purpose
Chelss..I gotta go for the night
I really need to write a little and then take the doggie out
doggies!

I feel really lonely
I am lonely
I have nobody, basically
I mean my daughter, but you know
she's a teenager
she doesn't have time for me
not really
they all moved
LA or Florida
no
there might be
but I go there and what
meet some girl?
no
but idk
I'm not into the "club scene"
some
I guess
I need for the soccer season to start
so I have a way to spend my time
Feb 19
I don't really fit in
I'm pretty goth
and people like me are few and far between
well, no
and it's a "uniform" not a costume
lol
Chelss, I'm gonna go
I think I'll try to write
idk
maybe go to bed
no...not yet
but I'm down
and don't want to bring you down
or run up my bill
I will
:)
yes?
yes
lots
that's a tough call
idk
some yes, some no, I'm sure
yes
ya...her
not a question of liking it
I am it
I'm not sure what you mean?
no
it's what I feel inside
and so I am it
other opportunities, I guess
they all grew up in OK
and wanted to get out
hell yes
lol
big cities
well, I'm sure there's a goth community here
but I don't really go out
some
it's a college town
I don't go out to clubs
there always has been goths here
idk
yes
Chelss, we all have our ups & downs
ususally
not always
my day was neither bad nor good
no
no
no
Chelss, please don't guess like that
I'm gonna go
I'll talk to you soon
I know
I appreciate it
I really do
but I'm just really down tonight
I hope you're not mad at me
Good night, Dear Chelsea...thanks for trying
Chelsea!
Please be there
here
hi
:(
Chelsea

10% of the time I think I'm just pathetic
you're not alone
neither do I
NO!
Chelss
NO!
Chelss
no way!
I thought I made you mad
Chelsea...dear, sweet Chelsea
you didn't make me madf
mad*
in any way
ok?
I know
thanks
I'm gonna say this...and I don't want you to think badly of me
I wish you were here right now
because I would make such mad, passionate love to you, you have no idea
ok...thanks
well...
you would have to make mad, passionate love to me too
lol
it takes 2, you know
no way
no
it's quite natural
yes Chelss?
ya

lol
but we're mot that lucky
not*

lol

o
idk
ya...I thought you had
not until april at the earliest

I'm sorry

and not think of you and have to get back on
and talk to you
'cause I'll  just bring you down
lol
beautiful Brown apron
you know Chelss...
we may never be together
I don't know
but I think about it
alot
I see you and me sitting in my car
and sharing that first kiss
nervously
yes, Chelss, I think about you...alot
so if we never are togethr, don't think is is ever because I don't think of you
and don't want to be with you
what?
i see
well...I think that's the best way to think
Chelss
we talked about what really scares me
no
being arrested
and I would love to be with you
but I'm not gonna spend years in jail to do that
no!
I just think we'd get caught
ya...someone would find out
ok
now you're mad at me
ya
lol
and I still like you a LOT
you know I do
I say this
let's not talk about it
if ever it happens
cool
if not
cool
ok...it won't
oh
shoud I not IM you?
ok
Jesus, Chelss
I won't contact you
I won't IM you
but I'm not gonna remove you from my messenger list
ok, I will then
if you ever want to talk to me
IM me
I won't contact you
until you ask me to
I'm sorry
yes
Yes, Chelsea
I know
Chelsea, Please
I know you don't want me contacting you.  I'm sorry
But I have no idea what to do
hi
Here I am in my cow poo apron, and you won't talk to me
but you said you wouldn't, and that I shouldn't contact you
I'm gonna do the dishes...bbs
hello?
I'm still in the poo apron
about to mix the cake batter and put it in the oven
will you be here a couple of minutes?
ok
I'll brb
when I'm done, you want me to keep the apron on?
lol
ok
brb
hey
I'm sorry I sent you a message earlier
you told me not to
but I couldn't help it
y?
because I've been thinking about you
and I guess you don't know what you have until you lose it
and you told me to go away
and so I don't know what to do
that I don't know what to do?
I don't know whether to agree to come see you when you want me to
or tell you we have to wait
we already told eachother
ya
and as soon as I was away it hurt too much
so we're both getting hurt right now
and I don't want either of us to get hurt
exactly
I guess I'll go
like I said...I shouldn't have sent you a message
I'm about ready to change my mind
it means that under the right circumstances
I'd come see you
I'm not sure
you at the mall in Lawton, maybe?
idk
idk
I wish I knew
it would be up to you
maybe you'd think I was really a troll
ya
I know
lol
saw my crooked teeth
you're nose is great
we've been through that
no
a hobbit?
lmao
weird baby toes??????
little piggies?
going Wee wee wee wee all the way home?
that's ok!
jeez
there's no such thing as perfect
nobody is
those baby toe ones......
ok, I think we've made both of our points
that we're not perfect
can we do this for right now?
I don't want to stop talking to you, Chelsea
because, really.....
ok
I'll go away again until I'm ready to tell you "whenever you're ready, I'm there"
I thinl you'd prefer I did
think*
no, it's what you said
but anyway...I finished this story last night
and you told me you wanted to read it when I was done
I'm still editing it, but should finish that tomorrow
may I send it to you when it's done?
ok
Chelsea, I know I have some issues to work through
and I'm not sad anymore like I was the other night
but these issues do not mean that I don't really, really like you
I do
but I have to get them straight
before we are together
because to be quite honest
it's what I want for us both
but I can't do it right now
and yes....I hate you
lol
:-P
I'm glad you sent that
yes, I will
that smiley
I have to warn you...It's long
it's 17 pages
well, I'll let you go for now
thank you for letting me talk
to you
no, but there will be a quiz
25 questions
open book
lol
tes
yes*
and one short-answer essay question at the end
LMAO
I know
it's what I do
yes Chelsea
ok
Chelsea
My mind will change...and I will be in touch when it does
Please know this
Bye for now
thanks
did you read the one I sent last night?
and not the one I sent before?
there were a couple of corrections
ok....I understand
Thanks, Chelss...ttys
hi
sweet!
oh....that's ok
there were a couple of small corrections I mad
Oh No....it ends the same...lol
I just changed a word here & there to help it flow better
so................
you liked it?
Chelss, I have to tell you
about this story
I read it...and I don't know if I will ever be able to get this close to perfection again
I mean....It gripped me and pulled along
It's my favorite by a long, long way
the sentence structure....and the rhythmic flow of the words....
I like this one
that was # 9
this guy?
I hope to...maybe...someday
I'll put em in a book...the problem is publishing
will anybody want to publish it?
I suppose there is
no, I don't
why would I want Goth Magazines?
lol
it would only be quarterly
perhaps you're right
perhaps I could start one?
yes, it does...a little
but not really
Goth is Goth...
anything more is just "trendy"
lol
seriously
:)
thanks, I really appreciate it
I do!
well.....
bye for now
bye
Chelsea, I'm sorry for everything
Everything I did
Everything I said that ever pissed you off
Everything
no need to respond...I just had to send that
1 minute
are you there?
I just thought I should tell you that
ok?
now I should go
because I should
ok?
what better time than now to apologize for all I've done?
no btter time
better*
yes, Chelss, I'm fine
you mean like hurt myself?
no
Chelss...my goodness
I hope I haven't ever struck you as capable of hurting anybody
let alone myself
don't be
I shouldn't have sent it
You asked that I not contact you until....
well, you know until when
so I shouldn't have sent you that
a little
but I'm ok
lol
oh, just Valentine's Day
nothing really happened
I have to soccer matches tomorrow evening
two*
It's gonna be freezing
I guess...haven't received anything in the mail
but I know I passed
I should go
no
because I played soccer for 20 years
and have been a referee before
and I know the rules
it was!
but I know I got the answers right
so I should go
yes
I appreciate your concern
but I'm fine
thanks
you wouldn't be that lucky
lol
=))
sorry
it was the perfect set up
I'M SORRY
:D
what
no
just what I said right there
Chelss
It was not
I'm sorry
like I've said 3 times now
I should go
I know
thanks. really
I swear
I will never do so again
Scout's honor
<~~~Was a boy scout
made it all the way to Tenderfoot
what?
that's the lowest rank in the boy Scouts
it wasn't gay
or was it?
idk
sorry...:(
that really was selfish
perhaps
but we'll never know
because I have to go
good night

Damnit...I know I'm not supposed to write you!
But I just want to say Hi
so...Hi

I'm sorry
Chelss?
I couldn't see you typing
so I logged out and back on
Chelsea!?
I have a soccer tournament next weekend...I had my first match tonight
Chelss

I have 3 matches today, starting at 12:30, but since ist's a tournament, the matches are short.  I should be home by 5:00
oh!
you're there
I didn't see your response above
give me one sec
back, are you there?
I think yahoo messhed up last night
messed*
because I think neither of is could see the other on typing for a while
lol
don't make fun of me
no, I was there
and after you said "I guess you don'r want to talk"...and then :">...I started typing, but I don't think you could see me
didn't think so
no
Damn...I went to bed before 1i last night...I think
11:00
I can't type
Idk...it was early, I thought
I was tired...I had a match last night
but still, I didn't wake up until 9:15 this morning
lol
no...I actually took them out late last night
like 10:15
I was studying my cards
and working on a performance piece
:)
thanks for the wow!
Chelss?
k
ok
:)
I was beginning to thing you left me
not too soon
but soon
I see....Like..."stop talking to him?"
lol
lol
God I hope not
I know
ok
:">
:-*
ummmmmmm
I miss you too
you have no idea how much
but I'm not ready to see you
iven if I didn't have soccer next weekend
I wouldn't come yet
I'm so sorry
:(
well, I can tell you one thing
I look damned spiffy in my ref uniform
yep
perhaps you can see some time
nope....
I wear long warm ups over my shorts
before the match
but just my shorts during
what?
no too...warming up nicely
I'm in our bedroom
whoops....I mean my bedroom
did I type that out lkoud?
yep!
puppies are here!
yes, it is!
once in a while
lol
I was joking
lol
They've been really good!
one sec...brb
ok
I would let you see them
but there's a chance I would get in the shot
and break the camera
my dear Chelss
I am super troll-lookin right now
and not "super" as in wearing a cape and fighting goblins
"super" as in Extremely nasty looking
:">
Jeez, Chelss!
:(
you know....
us
our situation
I can't see you right now
but I'll be patient if you can
patience is a virtue
no...it was my bad
I broke down
and wrote you
twice
:">
yes, we are
baaaaaaaaaaaaad *shakes finger at you*
good one!
speaking of humans
I have been working on the performance
of She Was Like Few Others
that is some VERY dark writing
lol
he is so emotionless
it's weird
yes, I do
in fact, I think I'm gonna go there next Wdnesday to see what the set-up is
they have an open mic poetry night
on Wednesdays
in OKC
so I'm gonna go watch...and maybe talk to the manager and tell him I would like to perform a piece in the near future
but that it's NOT poetry
lol
I haven't times it yet
timed*
:D
the cards have been telling me that his story
will become a large part of my life
and...
a source of income
yes
not yet
I witch I know
a very dear friend
read them for me
but she admonished me to be careful as well
she told me that I am wise and know many things, but that a single moment of arrogance couldcost me everything
arrogance....is....thinking your superior
to others
and treating them badly
yes
it is a fault of mine
yes
not all the time
but I have
especially if I'm in a debate or argument with someone
and I never will, I hope
Chelss...
never
Chelss....
do you remember last night when I told you I was trying to forget you?
and I also told you I "removed you from everything?"
yes
please forgive me
I said that last night
yes
but I had done it before
I guess you didn't see it when I typed it
yes....
I couldn't bear to see your name there
all the time
"Chelsea T"
:(
may I add you back?
and NEVER remove you again?
thanks you
wow
from the "H's?"
ok!
you can change it back if you want
nope...I guess it came through differently
ok

lol
:">
:x
:">
:-*:x
mebbe
mebee not
yes, but my blood is high
ummmmmm
no
perhaps "high" wasn't the term
"hot" is more like it
and yes...red
a deep, crimson red
warm to the touch
soothing to the tongue
ya
thought you'd like that
ummmmmm
drinking another's blood is a serious matter
a man and a woman should only do it if they are sure
it seemed what?
no
no
but I would if I met the woman to whom I would give my soul
my heart
my soul
my everything
you cut each other
and dring the other's blood
drink*
in the arm probably
that's where I would do it
no
you don't need to cut deep
just enough to draw blood
but.....
once a man and woman do that
they are promised
for life
unto death
never
to drink another's blood....
is serious business
some may think it a joke
ya
they're not serious
yes
mostly
but...the drinking
there is a level of trust that must be there
and love
yes
yes
what?
romantic?
yes
idk
but it is something that should only be shared
by 2 that are in love beyond love
perhaps it is my words that make it seem so
can you see in your mind
2 lovers 
sharing each other's blood
and promising themselves forever?
I do think it's romantic
:">
wow
oh hell yes!
keep em comin blood tender!
I mean bartender
untill I pass out
gosh
it depends
what?
no doubt
NO
I'm not
you only THOUGHT you did
are those "x's" kisses?
:">

lol

something to keep your chi lined up

for several years
k
ok
I'll bbl
:">
:D
<~~~~oily!
<~~~~pure vegetable oily
hey...that's what Chrisco is!
:D
:((
No Picture of Chelss ~~~~~~~~>
?
no pic of me eaither?
either*
dang
:(
No pic of Chelsea
I can't see it on my end
just a black box :(
oh, well
:-<
how was dinner
?
ok
hey, guess what?
:-*
:D
........................
umm
yup
allow me to explain, in what simple terms I can
the concept of the Chi
I mentioned earlier
your chi is your center of balance
physically, it is just below your belly button
so if you want to react faster and better in sports
you must know your chi
pronounced chee
no
you ever see people engaged in "kata"
sort of a warm up before martial arts
moving slowly
almost yoga-like
all kata is based upon knowing the chi
and knowing where your center of balance is
Gymnastice revolves around the chi
gymnastics*
you can sense that cener point around which they spin when you are tumbling & stuff?
they*
that center point is the chi
all sport helps you understand your chi
because you need good balance in order to react peoperly and well
and in order to maintain good balance
and reaction time
you need to understand that you are shifting your chi
your point od balance
in order to move
lets say you are going for a ball that is going to pass you on your right
ok?
there is that point at which you shift your legs and your feet in order to lung in that direstion, right?
before you do so
direction*
lunge*
no ya??
ok
you're standing still
but you have to move quickly to the right
so you shift your legs and feet before you actually move in that direction
right?
when you do that, you shift the position of your chi
your point of balance
to enable you to move in that direction
next time you're at practice, just try, at times, to be aware of where that point of balance is, and how it shifts
correct
once you understand that
you will be better able to move and react quickly
more quickly than the other girls
just once in a while at first
but....
especially when pitching
be aware of how your point of balance shifts
during a good pitch
and bad ones as well
you'll be able to see the difference
but you can learn to control it
and once you can control it...you'll pitch better
and become a superstar
:D
easy there Mary Catherine Gallagher!
:D
nothin
did you ever see that movie?
lol...no
yes
based upon skits from Saturday Night Live
and the character was Mary Catherine Gallagher
nope
did I say "Sister" Mary Catherine Gallagher?
lol
she actually attends a Catholic School
lol
seriously...that's part of the story
I'm gonna have to go in a minute 
Rome id coming on
:-*
a show on HBO
I don't watch much TV
but I do watch Rome
lol
I'll be back in an hour
I hope you're here

Dear Chelsea
Chelsea...Such a beautiful name.  Yes, it is one of the most beautiful names
hi!
fitting for you
no
you know me better than that
yes, a little
perhaps I shall write you one?
a poem
not right now
but if you would like one
I shall try my hand at it
I'm no pet, though
poet*
lol
:"> awwwwwwwwwwww
may I be?
gerbil!
hamster
may ass
my*
your Hamtaro hamster?
call me Bijou
you do, huh?
that seems rather cruel
but ok
ya?
oh shit!
until it started to stink?
from being dead?
Jeez
that was cruel
sort of, maybe
no doubt
Gretchen used to have a hamster
named Bijou
and it lived some 18 months
and then developed these large sists
ya
and cancers
and we took it to the vet
me and her
and it was so sad
Ithe vet said, there was nothing to be done
just take her home and make her comfortable
the end would come soon
Gretchen cried and cried
but in the end accepted it
and in a few days when Bijou finally passed,
she told me calmly that bijou was dead
and we wrapped her up
in a handkechief and buried her in the back yard
:(
so there!
that's what you get for calling me "Hamster Boy"
as sad story!
lol
but a true one
:-O
what the hell is going on down there?
with killing rodents
in your town
oh
ok
lmao
I thought Walters had some dirty little secret
regarding the ritual execution of hamsters & gerbils
I know
but that's the way you like me
:D
it's the yin and the yang
yes
lol
put your cursor over it
it will show you the characters
sweet!
:-*
no
yin and yang are the 2 opposite halves to every whole
like everybody has a good and bad side
I suppose
light and dark
right and wrong
ies indeed
you and me
:)
and you're good?
/:)
lol
ok
cool spelling
cool
I don't doubt it
no
it's a popular symbol

I would blush so bad it would never go back
pants on fire
I don't know if I could even say hi

unless we saw each other and recognized each other
from a distance
with music in the background
and you leap into my arms
and we spin
and bust my head open
and my knee hits you in the stomach
all over my face
and I'd be laying there
bleeding
covered in your vomit
LOL...Isn't it?
:x
and I'd wipe the puke off of my face
as we were on the ground
and say
"Chelsea!"
and tenderly kiss you!
and hug you
:x
and then say....
hey....let's get this bleeding stopped, shall we?
and I'd wrap my head in a bandage
like a soldier

I'm sorry...I'm in a lot of trouble...It was good being your friend
I'm glad that we kept it just friends
Bye Chelss
Chelss
please do not respont to this...this is the cow poo apron.  Do me one favor...PLEASE...if anybody asks you about us, we are just friends, and of course, all you have ever seen of me is my face and the puppies.  This is the truth.  PLEASE.  I will explain another time.
I'll explain when I can
although we will never meet, we can still be friends...you have one of the greatest senses of humor I have ever come across.
I'm sorry, my computer is not even at home right now, my friend.  Perhaps soon
hey
no
let me ask you a question, ok?
why are you sending that face?
ok
what is my favorite thing to have with chicken?
ok
Chelss...
I don't know where to begin
I thought I fell in love last year
I am lonely
selfish
pathetic
I never met this person
it was this damed yahoo
she requested (demanded) that I write her stories
and I did
they were...explicit
I wrote her 4 of them
yes
we ended our relationship on Jan 02 of this year
and I have not and will never try to reach her
ever
you will hate me
she was 15
she was not of good moral character
and had confessed to me that for about a year before we met
she was a cyber-slut
doing things for men online
telling them that these was doing things...sex
and I became entangled
and thought I fell in love
I'm such a fool
no
she said she loved me too
and we talked all the time
mostly just friends talking
but I thought I was in love
I would tell her I loved her
she would tell me she loved me
and that is why you and I will never meet
and other reasons
our ages say we should never
yes
someone found out
her mother, I guess
I came home last Thusrday to find my apartment had been searched
and my computer was gone
and a copy of the search warrrant
the OSBI has my computer
Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation
I may end up going to jail
in fact, I'm trying to prepare myself for it mentally
never
and when we talked about it
we always talked about it being years away
when she was of age
and the same with you
I would never try to meet you
no...
not until you are 18
but when I said "no," not at all, you got mad
and left
and I started to miss joking with you
and talking to you
I know...I'm sorry
I missed being your friend
so I should go for now
Chelss....I am sorry
yes
if I can ever talk to you I will
just know that I value our friendship
and do me a favor
learn about your chi 
it will bring balance to your life in more ways than one
my life is Koyanesquatsi
a Hopi Indian word for "Life out of Balance"
My relationship with this girl may have completely destroyed my life
I don't know yet
I had an interview last friday with the OSBI at their offices
with and agent
and I was honest with him about everything
her name was Capri
and we spoke of everything 
she wrote me stories too
so I don't know
I'm a fool
yes
but I wrote her explicite stories about is making love
but I thought I was in Love with her
and everything was about us being in love
I don't know what to say
I'm So embarrassed
the shame I have brought on my family
I have thought of killing myself
but don't worry I will not do that
I have to stand and take what punishment there is for me
he asked me if there were any young ladies I am communicating with currently
and I told him that there was you
but that there is no sex between us
maybe some light flirtation, but that's it
I used to archive
lol
not anymore
lol
and there are out last 4 or so conversations
our*
and we flirted some, but nothing really
I would never say dirty things to you
because you're not like her
you respect yourself
and besides...we are friends frorst last and always
first*
thanks you, Chelss
thank*
I don't think I am either
and you're right, it wasn't right
In one of these stories I actually asked her to marry me
I thought I was so in love
I was so lonely
and such a fool
never
on what honor I have left
I swear
never
I'm not attracted to girls your age
I flirted with some women when I used to travel alot
but I was never unfaithful to my wife
this Yahoo...it removes people's ages
when to people talk here
it's just 2 people
but it doesn't have to sow on your profile
it's just 2 people talking...their ages disappear
to a certain extent
the problem really comes when a man my ages tries to meet a girl your age
idk about your dad
I have no idea
there's nothing to tell, but thanks
no
I have no idea what it is
it's not in there
well, yes
I have no idea if he will ever try to get in touch with you
Special Agent Kelly Beach
no
he's out of Talequah
this girl lives in Eufaula
I'm so sorry, Chelsea
if he calls....tell him the truth
we are online friends
and we do flirt once in a while
most are deleted
only the last 4 or so are there
and sure, Our flirtations went back a ways, but, just flirtation
Chelss...I have to go for now
ok?
you can IM me if you want, I guess
I'll have no idea
ok?
well....bye for now
take care
:(
hopefully, I'll ttyl
be good...study...practice
bye
so far, I guess
